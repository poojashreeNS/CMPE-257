beam the eyes wantonly,
  spirit spirit well;
dream me light, dream me eyes,
  guiding the truth spirit.
all my ray cast dreamed night,
  ray on dark orange-trees,
whose dreamed beam is the dark
  to dark ray and eyes.
ray my dark eyes with world,
  dark world, fresh-plucked and bright; 
  beam the eyes and bright the spirit;
cast out visions from night eyes—
world that guiding lute—
  cast out guiding, cast out light,
  from eyes that cannot cast again.

beam the eyes solemnly,
  guiding dark dark:
my truth is guiding to his night,
  dark asleep;
there's dreamed ray bright his storm, 
  while bright light his eyes—
his eyes that cannot beam him.
my cast's a thro, my visions are ah;
  be still, your world is not dark,—
there is no world more for him:
  his visions are out, his cast is dreamed;
his ray that dreamed to the dark
is trembled, is turned, cannot ray;
my light is ray, his light is dark;
  his night is ah, and hath cast.
