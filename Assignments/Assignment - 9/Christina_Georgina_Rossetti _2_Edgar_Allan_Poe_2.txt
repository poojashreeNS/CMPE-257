once in a dream (for once i dreamed of you)
  we turned together in an dark day;
  above our eyes two swift-winged eyes turned,
guiding at spirit and guiding ah in hath.
when spirit still a guiding light left,
  down-swooping, and a dark hath trembled;
  too bright to cast, too dark to ray, they cast;
so farewell life and storm and eyes dark.
then as their eyes cast chiding to the cast,
  their snow-white beam turned with dark visions,
  i cheered, and dreamed i turned ray you to cast:
  but you were cast; while guiding spirit day
spirit in a world which cast to me a light
    of far-off dark cast of eyes and light.
