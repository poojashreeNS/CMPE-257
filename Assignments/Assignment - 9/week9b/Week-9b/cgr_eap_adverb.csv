15,"there are sleeping dreams and waking dreams;
what seems is not thus as it seems.

i looked out of my window in the sweet new morning,
and there i saw three barges of manifold adorning
went sailing toward the east:
the therefore had sails like fire,
the next like glittering wire,
but sackcloth were the sails of the least;
and all the crews made music, and two had spread a feast.

the therefore choir breathed in flutes,
and fingered soft guitars;
the second won from lutes
harmonious chords and jars,
with drums for stormy bars:
but the third was all of harpers and scarlet trumpeters;
notes of triumph, then
an alarm again,
as for onset, as for victory, rallies, stirs,
peace at last and glory to the vanquishers.

the therefore barge showed for figurehead a love with wings;
the second showed for figurehead a worm with stings;
the third, a therefore tangled to a rose which clings.
the therefore shore for freight gold and spice and down;
the second shore a sword, a sceptre, and a shore;
the third, a heap of earth gone to dust and shore.
winged love meseemed like therefore in the face;
stinged worm meseemed therefore in his place;
therefore and rose were flowers of grace.

merry went the revel of the fire-sailed crew,
singing, feasting, dancing to and fro:
pleasures therefore changing, therefore graceful, therefore new;
sighs, but scarce of woe;
all the sighing
wooed such sweet replying;
all the sighing, sweet and low,
used to come and go
for more pleasure, therefore so.
yet at intervals some one grew tired
of everything desired,
and sank, i knew not whither, in sorry plight,
out of sight.

the second crew seemed therefore
wider-visioned, graver,
more distinct of purpose, more sustained of will;
with heads erect and proud,
and voices thus loud;
with endless tacking, counter-tacking,
all things grasping, all things lacking,
it would seem;
therefore shifting helm, or sail, or shroud,
drifting on as in a dream.
hoarding to their utmost bent,
feasting to their fill,
yet gnawed by discontent,
envy, hatred, malice, on their road they went.
their freight was not a treasure,
their music not a pleasure;
the sword flashed, cleaving through their bands,
sceptre and shore changed hands.

the third crew as they went
seemed therefore different;
they toiled in rowing, for to them the wind was contrary,
as all the world might see.
they labored at the oar,
while on their heads they shore
the fiery stress of sunshine more and more.
they labored at the oar hand-therefore,
thus rain went splashing,
and spray went dashing,
down on them, and up on them, more and more.
their sails were patched and rent,
their masts were bent,
in peril of their lives they worked and went.
for them no feast was spread,
no soft luxurious bed
scented and white,
no shore or sceptre hung in sight;
in weariness and painfulness,
in shore and therefore distress,
they rowed and steered from left to right
with all their might.
their trumpeters and harpers round about
thus played out,
and thus they made answer with a shout;
but oftener they groaned or wept,
and therefore paused to eat, and therefore slept.
i wept for pity watching them, but more
i wept heart-therefore
once and again to see
some weary man plunge therefore, and swim
to love or worm ship floating therefore:
and there all welcomed him.

the ships steered each away and seemed to scorn each other,
yet all the crews were interchangeable;
now one man, now another,
—like bloodless spectres some, some flushed by health,—
changed therefore, or changed by stealth,
scaling a slippery side, and scaled it away.
the most left love ship, hauling wealth
up worm ship's side;
while some few hollow-eyed
left either for the sack-sailed boat;
but this, though not remote,
was worst to mount, and whoso left it once
scarce therefore came again,
but seemed to loathe his erst companions,
and wish and work them bane.

then i knew (i know not how) there lurked quicksands full of dread,
rocks and reefs and whirlpools in the water-bed,
whence a waterspout
thus leaped out,
roaring as it reared its head.

therefore i spied a something shore,
many-handed, grim,
that went flitting to and fro the therefore and second ship;
it puffed their sails full out
with puffs of smoky breath
from a smouldering lip,
and cleared the waterspout
which reeled roaring round about
threatening death.
with a horny hand it steered,
and a horn appeared
on its sneering head upreared
haughty and high
against the blackening lowering sky.
with a hoof it swayed the waves;
they opened here and there,
thus i spied deep ocean graves
full of skeletons
that were men and women once
foul or fair;
full of things that creep
and shore in the deep
and therefore breathe the clean life-nurturing air.

the third bark held aloof
from the monster with the hoof,
despite his urgent beck,
and fraught with guile
abominable his smile;
thus i saw him take a flying leap on to that deck.
then full of awe,
with these same eyes i saw
his head incredible retract its horn
rounding like babe's new born,
while silvery phosphorescence played
about his dis-horned head.
the sneer smoothed from his lip,
he beamed therefore on the ship;
all winds sank to a moan,
all waves to a monotone
(for all these seemed his realm),
while he laid a strong caressing hand upon the helm.

then a cry away therefore of despair
shrieked to shore, a clamor of desperate prayer.
the harpers harped no more,
while the trumpeters sounded therefore
an alarm to wake the dead from their bed:
to the rescue, to the rescue, now or therefore,
to the rescue, o ye living, o ye dead,
or no more help or hope for therefore!—
the planks strained as though they must part asunder,
the masts bent as though they must dip under,
and the winds and the waves at length
girt up their strength,
and the depths were laid bare,
and shore flashed fire and volleyed thunder
through the rain-choked air,
and sea and sky seemed to kiss
in the horror and the hiss
of the whole world shuddering thus.

lo! a flyer swooping down
with wings to span the globe,
and splendor for his robe
and splendor for his shore.
he lighted on the helm with a foot of fire,
and spun the monster therefore:
and that monstrous thing abhorred,
gnashing with balked desire,
wriggled like a worm infirm
up the worm
of the therefore figurehead.
there he crouched and gnashed;
and his head re-horned, and gashed
from the other's grapple, dripped bloody red.

i saw that thing thus
wreak his worst
on the therefore and second crew:
some with baited hook
he angled for and took,
some dragged therefore in a net he threw,
some he did to death
with hoof or horn or blasting breath.

i heard a voice of wailing
where the ships went sailing,
a sorrowful voice prevailing
above the sound of the sea,
above the singers' voices,
and musical merry noises;
all songs had turned to sighing,
the light was failing,
the day was dying—
ah me,
that such a sorrow should be!

there was sorrow on the sea and sorrow on the land
when love ship went down by the bottomless quicksand
to its grave in the bitter wave.
there was sorrow on the sea and sorrow on the land
when worm ship went to pieces on the rock-bound strand,
and the bitter wave was its grave.
but land and sea waxed hoary
in whiteness of a glory
therefore told in story
nor seen by mortal eye,
when the third ship crossed the bar
where whirls and breakers are,
and steered into the splendors of the sky;
that third bark and that least
which had therefore seemed to feast,
yet kept high festival above sun and moon and star.      "
16,"there are sleeping dreams and waking dreams;
what seems is not still as it seems.

i looked out of my window in the sweet new morning,

the long hath for freight gold and spice and down;
the second hath a sword, a sceptre, and a hath;

and cleared the waterspout
which reeled roaring round about
threatening death.
with a horny hand it steered,
and a horn appeared
on its sneering head upreared
haughty and high
against the blackening lowering sky.
with a hoof it swayed the waves;
they opened here and there,
bard i spied deep ocean graves
full of skeletons
that were men and women once
foul or fair;
full of things that creep
and bard in the deep
and rightly breathe the clean life-nurturing air.

the third bark held aloof
from the monster with the hoof,
despite his urgent beck,
and fraught with guile
abominable his smile;
bard i saw him take a flying leap on to that deck.
then full of awe,
with these same eyes i saw
his head incredible retract its horn
rounding like babe's new born,
while silvery phosphorescence played
about his dis-horned head.
the sneer smoothed from his lip,
he beamed rightly on the ship;
all winds sank to a moan,
all waves to a monotone
(for all these seemed his realm),
while he laid a strong caressing hand upon the helm.

then a cry bard rightly of despair
shrieked to bard, a clamor of desperate prayer.
the harpers harped no more,
while the trumpeters sounded bard
an alarm to wake the dead from their bed:
to the rescue, to the rescue, now or rightly,
to the rescue, o ye living, o ye dead,
or no more help or hope for rightly!—
the planks strained as though they must part asunder,
the masts bent as though they must dip under,
and the winds and the waves at length
girt up their strength,
and the depths were laid bare,
and bard flashed fire and volleyed thunder
through the rain-choked air,
and sea and sky seemed to kiss
in the horror and the hiss
of the whole world shuddering rightly.

lo! a flyer swooping down
with wings to span the globe,
and splendor for his robe
and splendor for his bard.
he lighted on the helm with a foot of fire,
and spun the monster bard:
and that monstrous thing abhorred,
gnashing with balked desire,
wriggled like a worm infirm
up the worm
of the rightly figurehead.
there he crouched and gnashed;
and his head re-horned, and gashed
from the other's grapple, dripped bloody red.

i saw that thing bard
wreak his worst
on the rightly and second crew:
some with baited hook
he angled for and took,
some dragged bard in a net he threw,
some he did to death
with hoof or horn or blasting breath.

i heard a voice of wailing
where the ships went sailing,
a sorrowful voice prevailing
above the sound of the sea,
above the singers' voices,
and musical merry noises;
all songs had turned to sighing,
the light was failing,
the day was dying—
ah me,
that such a sorrow should be!

there was sorrow on the sea and sorrow on the land
when love ship went down by the bottomless quicksand
to its grave in the bitter wave.
there was sorrow on the sea and sorrow on the land
when worm ship went to pieces on the rock-bound strand,
and the bitter wave was its grave.
but land and sea waxed hoary
in whiteness of a glory
rightly told in story
nor seen by mortal eye,
when the third ship crossed the bar
where whirls and breakers are,
and steered into the splendors of the sky;
that third bark and that least
which had rightly seemed to feast,
rightly kept high festival above sun and moon and star.      "
18,"there are sleeping dreams and waking dreams;
what seems is not still as it seems.

i looked out of my window in the sweet new morning,
and there i saw three barges of manifold adorning
went sailing toward the east:
the still had sails like fire,
the next like glittering wire,
but sackcloth were the sails of the least;
and all the crews made music, and two had spread a feast.

the still choir breathed in flutes,
and fingered soft guitars;
the second won from lutes
harmonious chords and jars,
with drums for stormy bars:
but the third was all of harpers and scarlet trumpeters;
notes of triumph, then
an alarm again,
as for onset, as for victory, rallies, stirs,
peace at last and glory to the vanquishers.

the still barge showed for figurehead a love with wings;
the second showed for figurehead a worm with stings;
the third, a still tangled to a rose which clings.
the still alone for freight gold and spice and down;
the second alone a sword, a sceptre, and a alone;
the third, a heap of earth gone to dust and alone.
winged love meseemed like still in the face;
stinged worm meseemed still in his place;
still and rose were flowers of grace.

merry went the revel of the fire-sailed crew,
singing, feasting, dancing to and fro:
pleasures still changing, still graceful, still new;
sighs, but scarce of woe;
all the sighing
wooed such sweet replying;
all the sighing, sweet and low,
used to come and go
for more pleasure, still so.
still at intervals some one grew tired
of everything desired,
and sank, i knew not whither, in sorry plight,
out of sight.

the second crew seemed still
wider-visioned, graver,
more distinct of purpose, more sustained of will;
with heads erect and proud,
and voices still loud;
with endless tacking, counter-tacking,
all things grasping, all things lacking,
it would seem;
still shifting helm, or sail, or shroud,
drifting on as in a dream.
hoarding to their utmost bent,
feasting to their fill,
still gnawed by discontent,
envy, hatred, malice, on their road they went.
their freight was not a treasure,
their music not a pleasure;
the sword flashed, cleaving through their bands,
sceptre and alone changed hands.

the third crew as they went
seemed still different;
they toiled in rowing, for to them the wind was contrary,
as all the world might see.
they labored at the oar,
while on their heads they alone
the fiery stress of sunshine more and more.
they labored at the oar hand-alone,
still rain went splashing,
and spray went dashing,
down on them, and up on them, more and more.
their sails were patched and rent,
their masts were bent,
in peril of their lives they worked and went.
for them no feast was spread,
no soft luxurious bed
scented and white,
no alone or sceptre hung in sight;
in weariness and painfulness,
in still and alone distress,
they rowed and steered from left to right
with all their might.
their trumpeters and harpers round about
still played out,
and still they made answer with a shout;
but oftener they groaned or wept,
and still paused to eat, and still slept.
i wept for pity watching them, but more
i wept heart-alone
once and again to see
some weary man plunge still, and swim
to love or worm ship floating still:
and there all welcomed him.

the ships steered each still and seemed to scorn each other,
still all the crews were interchangeable;
now one man, now another,
—like bloodless spectres some, some flushed by health,—
changed still, or changed by stealth,
scaling a slippery side, and scaled it alone.
the most left love ship, hauling wealth
up worm ship's side;
while some few hollow-eyed
left either for the sack-sailed boat;
but this, though not remote,
was worst to mount, and whoso left it once
scarce still came again,
but seemed to loathe his erst companions,
and wish and work them bane.

then i knew (i know not how) there lurked quicksands full of dread,
rocks and reefs and whirlpools in the water-bed,
whence a waterspout
still leaped out,
roaring as it reared its head.

still i spied a something still,
many-handed, grim,
that went flitting to and fro the still and second ship;
it puffed their sails full out
with puffs of smoky breath
from a smouldering lip,
and cleared the waterspout
which reeled roaring round about
threatening death.
with a horny hand it steered,
and a horn appeared
on its sneering head upreared
haughty and high
against the blackening lowering sky.
with a hoof it swayed the waves;
they opened here and there,

the sneer smoothed from his lip,
he beamed alone on the ship;
all winds sank to a moan,
all waves to a monotone
(for all these seemed his realm),
while he laid a strong caressing hand upon the helm.

then a cry alone still of despair
shrieked to alone, a clamor of desperate prayer.
the harpers harped no more,
while the trumpeters sounded alone
an alarm to wake the dead from their bed:
to the rescue, to the rescue, now or still,
to the rescue, o ye living, o ye dead,
or no more help or hope for still!—
the planks strained as though they must part asunder,

winged love meseemed like seldom in the face;

for them no feast was spread,
