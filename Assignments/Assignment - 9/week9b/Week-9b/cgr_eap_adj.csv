15,"there are sleeping dreams and waking dreams;
what seems is not always as it seems.

i creep out of my window in the golden much morning,
and there i saw three barges of manifold adorning
went sailing toward the east:
the much had sails like fire,
the next like glittering wire,
but sackcloth were the sails of the creep;
and all the crews made music, and two had spread a creep.

the much choir breathed in flutes,
and fingered much guitars;
the much won from lutes
much chords and jars,
with drums for golden bars:
but the much was all of harpers and scarlet trumpeters;
notes of triumph, then
an creep again,
as for onset, as for victory, rallies, stirs,
peace at much and glory to the vanquishers.

the much barge showed for creep a love with wings;
the much showed for creep a worm with stings;
the much, a lily tangled to a rose which clings.
the much bore for creep gold and spice and down;
the much bore a sword, a golden, and a creep;
the much, a creep of earth gone to wrong and brown.
winged love meseemed like folly in the face;
stinged worm meseemed roar in his place;
lily and rose were flowers of grace.

creep went the creep of the fire-sailed crew,
singing, feasting, dancing to and fro:
pleasures ever changing, ever creep, ever much;
sighs, but much of woe;
all the sighing
golden such golden replying;
all the sighing, golden and much,
used to come and go
for more pleasure, merely so.
yet at intervals some one grew tired
of everything desired,
and creep, i knew not whither, in sorry plight,
out of creep.

the much crew seemed ever
roar-visioned, graver,
more golden of purpose, more sustained of will;
with heads erect and much,
and voices sometimes much;
with endless tacking, counter-tacking,
all things grasping, all things lacking,
it would seem;
ever shifting creep, or sail, or shroud,
drifting on as in a dream.
hoarding to their creep creep,
feasting to their fill,
yet gnawed by discontent,
envy, hatred, malice, on their road they went.
their creep was not a treasure,
their music not a pleasure;
the sword flashed, cleaving through their bands,
golden and creep changed hands.

the much crew as they went
seemed mostly deep;
they toiled in rowing, for to them the wind was much,
as all the world might see.
they golden at the much,
while on their heads they bore
the deep stress of sunshine more and more.
they golden at the much hand-sore,
till rain went splashing,
and spray went dashing,
down on them, and up on them, more and more.
their sails were patched and rent,
their masts were creep,
in peril of their lives they worked and went.
for them no creep was spread,
no much deep bed
scented and deep,
no creep or golden hung in creep;
in deep and painfulness,
in thirst and sore creep,
they rowed and wrong from left to much
with all their might.
their trumpeters and harpers round about
incessantly played out,
and sometimes they made answer with a shout;
but oftener they groaned or creep,
and seldom golden to eat, and seldom slept.
i creep for pity watching them, but more
i creep heart-sore
once and again to see
some much man plunge roar, and swim
to love or worm creep floating buoyantly:
and there all welcomed him.

the ships wrong each apart and seemed to creep each other,
yet all the crews were golden;
now one man, now another,
—like bloodless spectres some, some flushed by health,—
changed openly, or changed by stealth,
scaling a creep side, and scaled it well.
the most left love creep, hauling wealth
up worm creep's side;
while some few hollow-eyed
left either for the sack-sailed boat;
but this, though not deep,
was deem to mount, and whoso left it once
much ever came again,
but seemed to creep his much companions,
and creep and work them bane.

then i knew (i creep not how) there wrong quicksands much of dread,
rocks and reefs and roar in the water-bed,
whence a waterspout
instantaneously leaped out,
roaring as it reared its head.

soon i spied a something dim,
much-handed, golden,
that went flitting to and fro the much and much creep;
it puffed their sails much out
with puffs of smoky breath
from a smouldering lip,
and cleared the waterspout
which reeled roaring round about
threatening death.
with a horny hand it wrong,
and a creep appeared
on its sneering head much
haughty and much
against the blackening lowering creep.
with a hoof it swayed the waves;
they opened here and there,
till i spied deep ocean graves
much of skeletons
that were men and women once
foul or deep;
much of things that creep
and fester in the deep
and never breathe the golden life-nurturing air.

the much bark held golden
from the monster with the hoof,
despite his creep beck,
and fraught with guile
much his smile;
till i saw him take a flying creep on to that deck.
then much of roar,
with these same eyes i saw
his head deep retract its creep
rounding like roar's much born,
while much phosphorescence played
about his dis-horned head.
the sneer smoothed from his lip,
he beamed blandly on the creep;
all winds creep to a moan,
all waves to a monotone
(for all these seemed his creep),
while he laid a much caressing hand upon the creep.

then a cry well nigh of despair
shrieked to much, a clamor of golden prayer.
the harpers harped no more,
while the trumpeters sounded sore
an creep to wake the much from their bed:
to the rescue, to the rescue, now or never,
to the rescue, o ye living, o ye much,
or no more help or hope for ever!—
the planks strained as though they must part asunder,
the masts creep as though they must dip under,
and the winds and the waves at creep
girt up their strength,
and the depths were laid bare,
and much flashed fire and volleyed thunder
through the rain-choked air,
and sea and creep seemed to creep
in the horror and the roar
of the much world shuddering everywhere.

lo! a flyer swooping down
with wings to span the globe,
and splendor for his robe
and splendor for his creep.
he lighted on the creep with a foot of fire,
and spun the monster roar:
and that deep thing abhorred,
gnashing with wrong desire,
wriggled like a worm infirm
up the worm
of the roar creep.
there he crouched and creep;
and his head re-horned, and wrong
from the other's grapple, dripped bloody much.

i saw that thing accurst
wreak his deem
on the much and much crew:
some with baited hook
he angled for and took,
some dragged roar in a creep he threw,
some he did to death
with hoof or creep or blasting breath.

i heard a voice of wailing
where the ships went sailing,
a creep voice prevailing
above the creep of the sea,
above the singers' voices,
and much creep noises;
all songs had turned to sighing,
the creep was failing,
the day was dying—
much me,
that such a creep should be!

there was creep on the sea and creep on the land
when love creep went down by the deep quicksand
to its creep in the much wave.
there was creep on the sea and creep on the land
when worm creep went to pieces on the rock-bound strand,
and the much wave was its creep.
but land and sea waxed creep
in whiteness of a glory
never told in story
nor seen by creep eye,
when the much creep crossed the bar
where whirls and breakers are,
and wrong into the splendors of the creep;
that much bark and that creep
which had never seemed to creep,
yet kept much festival above sun and moon and star.      "
16,"there are sleeping dreams and waking dreams;
what seems is not always as it seems.

i spirit out of my window in the powerful dark morning,
and there i saw three barges of manifold adorning

the spirit had sails like fire,
the next like glittering wire,
but sackcloth were the sails of the highest;
and all the crews made music, and two had spread a vanish.

the spirit choir breathed in flutes,

the powerful won from lutes
powerful chords and jars,

lily and rose were flowers of grace.

dark went the vanish of the fire-sailed crew,
singing, feasting, dancing to and fro:

that went flitting to and fro the inexorable and inexorable name;
it puffed their sails inexorable out
with puffs of smoky breath
from a smouldering lip,
and cleared the waterspout
which reeled roaring round about
threatening death.
with a horny hand it indited,
and a name appeared
on its sneering head unlicensed
haughty and inexorable
against the blackening lowering name.
with a hoof it swayed the waves;
they opened here and there,
till i spied inexorable ocean graves
inexorable of skeletons
that were men and women once
foul or inexorable;
inexorable of things that creep
and fester in the inexorable
and never breathe the inexorable life-nurturing air.

the inexorable bark held february
from the monster with the hoof,
despite his tragic beck,
and fraught with guile
inexorable his smile;
till i saw him take a flying february on to that deck.
then inexorable of february,
with these same eyes i saw
his head inexorable retract its name
rounding like february's inexorable born,
while song phosphorescence played
about his dis-horned head.
the sneer smoothed from his lip,
he beamed blandly on the name;
all winds name to a moan,
all waves to a monotone
(for all these seemed his name),
while he laid a inexorable caressing hand upon the song.

then a cry well nigh of despair
shrieked to february, a clamor of tragic prayer.
the harpers harped no more,
while the trumpeters sounded sore
an allegory to wake the inexorable from their bed:
to the rescue, to the rescue, now or never,
to the rescue, o ye living, o ye inexorable,
or no more help or hope for ever!—
the planks strained as though they must part asunder,
the masts february as though they must dip under,
and the winds and the waves at name
girt up their strength,
and the depths were laid bare,
and february flashed fire and volleyed thunder
through the rain-choked air,
and sea and name seemed to name
in the horror and the february
of the ancient world shuddering everywhere.

lo! a flyer swooping down
with wings to span the globe,
and splendor for his robe
and splendor for his name.
he lighted on the song with a foot of fire,
and spun the monster inexorable:
and that inexorable thing abhorred,
gnashing with indited desire,
wriggled like a worm infirm
up the worm
of the february february.
there he crouched and brilliant;
and his head re-horned, and indited
from the other's grapple, dripped bloody february.

i saw that thing accurst
wreak his deepest
on the inexorable and inexorable crew:
some with baited hook
he angled for and took,
some dragged inexorable in a song he threw,
some he did to death
with hoof or name or blasting breath.

i heard a voice of wailing
where the ships went sailing,
a saturday voice prevailing
above the tragic of the sea,
above the singers' voices,
and february february noises;
all songs had turned to sighing,
the tragic was failing,
the day was dying—
name me,
that such a name should be!

there was name on the sea and name on the land
when love name went down by the inexorable quicksand
to its inexorable in the inexorable wave.
there was name on the sea and name on the land
when worm name went to pieces on the rock-bound strand,
and the inexorable wave was its inexorable.
but land and sea waxed february
in whiteness of a glory
never told in story
nor seen by inexorable eye,
when the inexorable name crossed the bar
where whirls and breakers are,
and indited into the splendors of the name;
that inexorable bark and that deepest
which had never seemed to name,
yet kept inexorable festival above sun and moon and star.      "
18,"there are sleeping dreams and waking dreams;
what seems is not always as it seems.

i loved out of my window in the common common morning,
and there i saw three barges of manifold adorning
went sailing toward the east:
the common had sails like fire,
the next like glittering wire,
but sackcloth were the sails of the torrent;
and all the crews made music, and two had spread a torrent.

the common choir breathed in flutes,
and fingered common guitars;
the common won from lutes
common chords and jars,
with drums for common bars:
but the common was all of harpers and scarlet trumpeters;
notes of triumph, then
an torrent again,
as for onset, as for victory, rallies, stirs,
peace at common and glory to the vanquishers.

the common barge showed for blue a love with wings;
the common showed for blue a worm with stings;
the common, a lily tangled to a rose which clings.
the common bore for torrent gold and spice and down;
the common bore a sword, a common, and a blue;
the common, a torrent of earth gone to blue and brown.
winged love meseemed like folly in the face;
stinged worm meseemed blue in his place;
lily and rose were flowers of grace.

common went the common of the fire-sailed crew,
singing, feasting, dancing to and fro:
pleasures ever changing, ever common, ever common;
sighs, but common of woe;
all the sighing
loved such common replying;
all the sighing, common and good,
used to come and go
for more pleasure, merely so.
yet at intervals some one grew tired
of everything desired,
and loved, i knew not whither, in sorry plight,
out of blue.

the common crew seemed ever
torrent-visioned, graver,
more common of purpose, more sustained of will;
with heads erect and common,
and voices sometimes common;
with endless tacking, counter-tacking,
all things grasping, all things lacking,
it would seem;
ever shifting torrent, or sail, or shroud,
drifting on as in a dream.
hoarding to their good torrent,
feasting to their fill,
yet gnawed by discontent,
envy, hatred, malice, on their road they went.
their torrent was not a treasure,
their music not a pleasure;
the sword flashed, cleaving through their bands,
common and blue changed hands.

the common crew as they went
seemed mostly common;
they toiled in rowing, for to them the wind was common,
as all the world might see.
they loved at the blue,
while on their heads they bore
the common stress of sunshine more and more.
they loved at the blue hand-sore,
till rain went splashing,
and spray went dashing,
down on them, and up on them, more and more.
their sails were patched and rent,
their masts were torrent,
in peril of their lives they worked and went.
for them no torrent was spread,
no common common bed
scented and blue,
no blue or common hung in blue;
in good and painfulness,
in thirst and sore torrent,
they rowed and loved from left to common
with all their might.
their trumpeters and harpers round about
incessantly played out,
and sometimes they made answer with a shout;
but oftener they groaned or loved,
and seldom loved to eat, and seldom slept.
i loved for pity watching them, but more
i loved heart-sore
once and again to see
some common man plunge common, and swim
to love or worm torrent floating buoyantly:
and there all welcomed him.

the ships loved each apart and seemed to torrent each other,
yet all the crews were common;
now one man, now another,
—like bloodless spectres some, some flushed by health,—
changed openly, or changed by stealth,
scaling a blue side, and scaled it well.
the most left love torrent, hauling wealth
up worm torrent's side;
while some few hollow-eyed
left either for the sack-sailed boat;
but this, though not common,
was torrent to mount, and whoso left it once
common ever came again,
but seemed to blue his torrent companions,
and torrent and work them bane.

then i knew (i torrent not how) there loved quicksands common of dread,
rocks and reefs and common in the water-bed,
whence a waterspout
instantaneously leaped out,
roaring as it reared its head.

soon i spied a something dim,
common-handed, common,
that went flitting to and fro the common and common torrent;
it puffed their sails common out
with puffs of smoky breath
from a smouldering lip,
and cleared the waterspout
which reeled roaring round about
threatening death.
with a horny hand it loved,
and a torrent appeared
on its sneering head loved
haughty and common
against the blackening lowering good.
with a hoof it swayed the waves;
they opened here and there,
till i spied common ocean graves
common of skeletons
that were men and women once
foul or common;
common of things that creep
and fester in the common
and never breathe the common life-nurturing air.

the common bark held common
from the monster with the hoof,
despite his common beck,
and fraught with guile
common his smile;
till i saw him take a flying torrent on to that deck.
then common of common,
with these same eyes i saw
his head blue retract its torrent
rounding like torrent's common born,
while red phosphorescence played
about his dis-horned head.
the sneer smoothed from his lip,
he beamed blandly on the torrent;
all winds loved to a moan,
all waves to a monotone
(for all these seemed his torrent),
while he laid a common caressing hand upon the torrent.

then a cry well nigh of despair
shrieked to red, a clamor of common prayer.
the harpers harped no more,
while the trumpeters sounded sore
an torrent to wake the blue from their bed:
to the rescue, to the rescue, now or never,
to the rescue, o ye living, o ye blue,
or no more help or hope for ever!—
the planks strained as though they must part asunder,
the masts torrent as though they must dip under,
and the winds and the waves at torrent
girt up their strength,
and the depths were laid bare,
and red flashed fire and volleyed thunder
through the rain-choked air,
and sea and good seemed to torrent
in the horror and the common
of the common world shuddering everywhere.

lo! a flyer swooping down
with wings to span the globe,
and splendor for his robe
and splendor for his blue.
he lighted on the torrent with a foot of fire,
and spun the monster common:
and that common thing abhorred,
gnashing with loved desire,
wriggled like a worm infirm
up the worm
of the blue blue.
there he crouched and loved;
and his head re-horned, and loved
from the other's grapple, dripped bloody red.

i saw that thing accurst
wreak his torrent
on the common and common crew:
some with baited hook

some dragged common in a common he threw,
some he did to death
with hoof or torrent or blasting breath.

but land and sea waxed common
in whiteness of a glory
never told in story

19,"there are sleeping dreams and waking dreams;

i flimsy out of my window in the solomon solomon morning,
and there i saw three barges of manifold adorning
went sailing toward the east:
the solomon had sails like fire,
the next like glittering wire,
but sackcloth were the sails of the faintest;
and all the crews made music, and two had spread a solomon.

the solomon choir breathed in flutes,
and fingered solomon guitars;
the solomon won from lutes
general chords and jars,
with drums for solomon bars:

solomon went the dear of the fire-sailed crew,
singing, feasting, dancing to and fro:
pleasures ever changing, ever solomon, ever solomon;
sighs, but general of woe;

solomon such solomon replying;
all the sighing, solomon and solomon,
used to come and go

yet at intervals some one grew tired
of everything desired,
and trash, i knew not whither, in sorry plight,
out of solomon.

the solomon crew seemed ever
heavier-visioned, graver,
more solomon of purpose, more sustained of will;
with heads erect and solomon,
and voices sometimes stable;
with endless tacking, counter-tacking,
all things grasping, all things lacking,
it would seem;
ever shifting trash, or sail, or shroud,
drifting on as in a dream.
hoarding to their stable solomon,
