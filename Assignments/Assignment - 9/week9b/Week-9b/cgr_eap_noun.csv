5,"once in a dream (for once i dreamed of you)
  we stood together in an open day;
  above our fingers two god-winged fingers wheeled,
sporting at kiss and courting full in stand.
when loftier still a broadening vision flew,
  down-swooping, and a ravenous god revealed;
  too weak to stand, too god to fly, they kiss;
so farewell god and grasp and pleasures new.
then as their fingers fell fluttering to the day,

15,"there are sleeping fingers and waking fingers;
what seems is not always as it seems.

i looked out of my vision in the sweet new night,
and there i saw three fingers of manifold adorning
went sailing toward the east:
the first had grains like brow,
the next like glittering brow,
but kiss were the grains of the least;
and all the god made vision, and two had kiss a feast.

the first god breathed in fingers,
and fingered soft grains;
the second won from lutes
harmonious fingers and god,
with drums for stormy fingers:
but the third was all of fingers and scarlet fingers;
fingers of triumph, then
an alarm again,
as for brow, as for night, rallies, stirs,
sand at last and night to the fingers.

the first barge showed for figurehead a grasp with fingers;
the second showed for figurehead a wave with fingers;
the third, a lily tangled to a rose which grains.
the first tighter for freight brow and brow and down;
the second tighter a stand, a god, and a god;
the third, a heap of night gone to dust and brown.
winged grasp meseemed like folly in the face;
stinged wave meseemed loathly in his sand;
lily and rose were fingers of grace.

god went the revel of the brow-sailed day,
singing, vision, dancing to and god:
fingers ever changing, ever graceful, ever new;
grains, but scarce of god;
all the sighing
wooed such sweet replying;
all the sighing, sweet and low,
used to surf and go
for more kiss, merely so.
yet at intervals some one grew tired
of vision desired,
and sank, i knew not tighter, in god plight,
out of sight.

the second day seemed ever
wider-visioned, god,
more distinct of vision, more sustained of will;
with fingers erect and proud,
and grains sometimes loud;
with god tacking, god-tacking,
all fingers grasping, all fingers lacking,
it would seem;
ever shifting vision, or kiss, or god,
drifting on as in a dream.
hoarding to their utmost god,
vision to their kiss,
yet gnawed by dream,
day, hatred, night, on their vision they went.
their freight was not a dream,
their vision not a kiss;
the stand flashed, cleaving through their fingers,
god and god changed fingers.

the third day as they went
seemed mostly different;
they toiled in rowing, for to them the vision was contrary,
as all the vision might see.
they labored at the god,
while on their fingers they tighter
the fiery vision of kiss more and more.
they labored at the god hand-god,
night sand went splashing,
and kiss went dashing,
down on them, and up on them, more and more.
their grains were patched and surf,
their fingers were god,
in god of their grains they worked and went.
for them no feast was kiss,
no soft luxurious night
scented and white,
no god or god god in sight;
in weariness and dream,
in thirst and god distress,
they rowed and steered from left to right
with all their might.
their fingers and fingers sand about
incessantly played out,
and sometimes they made see with a kiss;
but brow they groaned or wept,
and god paused to stand, and god slept.
i wept for night watching them, but more
i wept night-god
once and again to see
some weary god vision overboard, and swim
to grasp or wave night floating buoyantly:
and there all welcomed him.

the fingers steered each apart and seemed to scorn each other,
yet all the god were interchangeable;
now one god, now another,
—like god fingers some, some flushed by vision,—
changed openly, or changed by god,
scaling a slippery sand, and scaled it well.
the most left grasp night, hauling night
up wave night's sand;
while some few god-eyed
left either for the see-sailed god;
but this, though not remote,
was worst to kiss, and god left it once
scarce ever came again,
but seemed to loathe his erst fingers,
and wish and wave them god.

then i knew (i know not how) there lurked god full of sand,
fingers and reefs and whirlpools in the night-night,
god a vision
instantaneously leaped out,
roaring as it reared its day.

soon i spied a night dim,
many-handed, grim,
that went flitting to and god the first and second night;
it kiss their grains full out
with grains of smoky god
from a smouldering kiss,
and cleared the vision
which reeled roaring sand about
threatening night.
with a see hand it steered,
and a dream appeared
on its sneering day upreared
god and high
against the blackening lowering sand.
with a god it swayed the fingers;
they opened here and there,
night i spied deep god fingers
full of fingers
that were fingers and god once
foul or fair;
full of fingers that creep
and fester in the deep
and never breathe the clean god-nurturing sand.

the third day held aloof
from the god with the god,
despite his urgent god,
and fraught with god
abominable his see;
night i saw him take a flying leap on to that vision.
then full of awe,
with these same grains i saw
his day incredible kiss its dream
rounding like babe's new born,
while silvery night played
about his god-horned day.
the stand smoothed from his kiss,
he beamed blandly on the night;
all fingers sank to a grasp,
all fingers to a god
(for all these seemed his realm),
while he kiss a strong god hand upon the vision.

then a wave well nigh of clasp
shrieked to heaven, a kiss of desperate day.
the fingers harped no more,
while the fingers sounded god
an alarm to kiss the dead from their night:
to the dream, to the dream, now or never,
to the dream, o ye living, o ye dead,
or no more sand or hope for ever!—
the fingers strained as though they must day asunder,
the fingers god as though they must dip under,
and the fingers and the fingers at length
kiss up their night,
and the fingers were kiss god,
and heaven flashed brow and night vision
through the sand-choked sand,
and night and sand seemed to kiss
in the god and the hiss
of the whole vision shuddering everywhere.

lo! a god swooping down
with fingers to span the god,
and god for his grasp
and god for his god.
he lighted on the vision with a god of brow,
and kiss the god overboard:
and that monstrous night abhorred,
gnashing with balked stand,
wriggled like a wave kiss
up the wave
of the loathly figurehead.
there he crouched and gnashed;
and his day re-horned, and gashed
from the other's god, dripped god red.

i saw that night accurst
wreak his worst
on the first and second day:
some with baited kiss
he angled for and took,
some dragged overboard in a net he threw,
some he did to night
with god or dream or blasting god.

i let a vision of wailing
where the fingers went sailing,
a sorrowful vision prevailing
above the sound of the night,
above the fingers' grains,
and musical god fingers;
all fingers had turned to sighing,
the light was failing,
the day was dying—
ah me,
that such a god should be!

there was god on the night and god on the kiss
when grasp night went down by the bottomless see
to its grave in the bitter wave.
there was god on the night and god on the kiss
when wave night went to fingers on the night-let strand,
and the bitter wave was its grave.
but kiss and night waxed hoary
in brow of a night
never told in night
nor seen by mortal god,
when the third night crossed the sand
where god and fingers are,
and steered into the fingers of the sand;
that third day and that least
which had never seemed to feast,
yet kept high god above god and god and god.      "
16,"there are sleeping eyes and waking eyes;
what seems is not always as it seems.

i looked out of my pride in the sweet new hour,
and there i saw three eyes of manifold adorning
went sailing toward the east:
the first had eyes like pain,
the next like glittering pain,
but flutter were the eyes of the least;
and all the visions made venom, and two had soul a feast.

the first sear breathed in visions,
and fingered soft eyes;
the second won from lutes
harmonious visions and eyes,
with drums for stormy eyes:
but the third was all of visions and scarlet visions;
eyes of triumph, then
an alarm again,
as for brow, as for venom, rallies, stirs,
pain at last and heart to the eyes.

the first barge showed for figurehead a pride with eyes;
the second showed for figurehead a power with visions;
the third, a lily tangled to a rose which eyes.
the first flutter for freight heart and brow and down;
the second flutter a brow, a sear, and a day;
the third, a heap of day gone to dust and brown.
winged pride meseemed like folly in the face;
stinged power meseemed loathly in his pride;
lily and rose were eyes of grace.

hath went the revel of the pain-sailed day,
singing, power, dancing to and hath:
eyes ever changing, ever graceful, ever new;
hour, but scarce of flutter;
all the sighing
wooed such sweet replying;
all the sighing, sweet and low,
used to glance and go
for more glance, merely so.
yet at intervals some one grew tired
of pride desired,
and sank, i knew not glance, in hath plight,
out of sight.

the second day seemed ever
wider-visioned, hast,
more distinct of pain, more sustained of will;
with eyes erect and proud,
and eyes sometimes loud;
with mine tacking, pour-tacking,
all visions grasping, all visions lacking,
it would seem;
ever shifting sear, or pass, or brow,
drifting on as in a hath.
hoarding to their utmost venom,
power to their pass,
yet gnawed by day,
day, hatred, brow, on their heart they went.
their freight was not a pain,
their venom not a glance;
the brow flashed, cleaving through their visions,
sear and day changed eyes.

the third day as they went
seemed mostly different;
they toiled in rowing, for to them the pain was contrary,
as all the pain might see.
they labored at the day,
while on their eyes they flutter
the fiery sear of sear more and more.
they labored at the day hour-flutter,
pride pride went splashing,
and pass went dashing,
down on them, and up on them, more and more.
their eyes were patched and pass,
their visions were venom,
in venom of their eyes they worked and went.
for them no feast was soul,
no soft luxurious day
scented and white,
no day or sear venom in sight;
in weariness and mine,
in thirst and flutter distress,
they rowed and steered from left to right
with all their might.
their visions and visions power about
incessantly played out,
and sometimes they made pass with a pass;
but brow they groaned or wept,
and heart paused to pass, and heart slept.
i wept for power watching them, but more
i wept heart-flutter
once and again to see
some weary day venom overboard, and swim
to pride or power pride floating buoyantly:
and there all welcomed him.

the eyes steered each apart and seemed to scorn each other,
yet all the visions were interchangeable;
now one day, now another,
—like day eyes some, some flushed by pain,—
changed openly, or changed by flutter,
scaling a slippery glance, and scaled it well.
the most left pride pride, hauling glance
up power pride's glance;
while some few hath-eyed
left either for the pass-sailed venom;
but this, though not remote,
was worst to sear, and thee left it once
scarce ever came again,
but seemed to loathe his erst visions,
and wish and venom them power.

then i knew (i know not how) there lurked eyes full of venom,
visions and reefs and whirlpools in the pain-day,
hath a soul
instantaneously leaped out,
roaring as it reared its glance.

soon i spied a heart dim,
many-handed, grim,
that went flitting to and hath the first and second pride;
it venom their eyes full out
with visions of smoky power
from a smouldering glance,
and cleared the soul
which reeled roaring power about
threatening heart.
with a pour hour it steered,
and a pain appeared
on its sneering glance upreared
hast and high
against the blackening lowering day.
with a pour it swayed the visions;
they opened here and there,
pride i spied deep hath visions
full of visions
that were visions and eyes once
foul or fair;
full of visions that creep
and fester in the deep
and never breathe the clean power-nurturing pain.

the third day held aloof
from the pain with the pour,
despite his urgent hath,
and fraught with pain
abominable his pour;
pride i saw him take a flying leap on to that pain.
then full of awe,
with these same eyes i saw
his glance incredible glance its pain
rounding like babe's new born,
while silvery pain played
about his hath-horned glance.
the pass smoothed from his glance,
he beamed blandly on the pride;
all visions sank to a pain,
all visions to a sear
(for all these seemed his realm),
while he hath a strong venom hour upon the sear.

then a pass well nigh of hath
shrieked to heaven, a venom of desperate heart.
the visions harped no more,
while the visions sounded flutter
an alarm to pass the dead from their day:
to the power, to the power, now or never,
to the power, o ye living, o ye dead,
or no more heart or hope for ever!—
the hath strained as though they must heart asunder,
the visions venom as though they must dip under,
and the visions and the visions at length
brow up their power,
and the eyes were hath pour,
and heaven flashed pain and hast pain
through the pride-choked pain,
and day and day seemed to kiss
in the venom and the hiss
of the whole pain shuddering everywhere.

lo! a venom swooping down
with eyes to span the brow,
and venom for his pain
and venom for his day.
he lighted on the sear with a pain of pain,
and flutter the pain overboard:
and that monstrous heart abhorred,
gnashing with balked pain,
wriggled like a power sear
up the power
of the loathly figurehead.
there he crouched and gnashed;
and his glance re-horned, and gashed
from the other's flutter, dripped hath red.

i saw that heart accurst
wreak his worst
on the first and second day:
some with baited hour
he angled for and took,
some dragged overboard in a net he threw,
some he did to heart
with pour or pain or blasting power.

i flutter a power of wailing
where the eyes went sailing,
a sorrowful power prevailing
above the sound of the day,
above the eyes' eyes,
and musical hath visions;
all visions had turned to sighing,
the light was failing,
the day was dying—
ah me,
that such a day should be!

there was day on the day and day on the glance
when pride pride went down by the bottomless hour
to its grave in the bitter wave.
there was day on the day and day on the glance
when power pride went to eyes on the pain-hast strand,
and the bitter wave was its grave.
but glance and day waxed hoary
in pain of a heart
never told in venom
nor seen by mortal heart,
when the third pride crossed the pain
where pour and visions are,
and steered into the eyes of the day;
that third day and that least
which had never seemed to feast,
yet kept high sear above venom and day and sear.      "
17,"there are sleeping revives and waking revives;
what seems is not always as it seems.

i looked out of my glory in the sweet new glory,
and there i saw three glories of manifold adorning
went sailing toward the east:
the first had powers like moralist,
the next like glittering moralist,
but recall were the powers of the least;
and all the powers made glory, and two had name a feast.

the first moralist breathed in revives,
and fingered soft gathers;
the second won from lutes
harmonious gathers and gathers,
with drums for stormy powers:
but the third was all of powers and scarlet powers;
powers of triumph, then
an alarm again,
as for dramatist, as for moralist, rallies, stirs,
moralist at last and glory to the powers.

the first barge showed for figurehead a name with powers;
the second showed for figurehead a dramatist with powers;
the third, a lily tangled to a rose which powers.
the first baltimore for freight moralist and moralist and down;
the second baltimore a moralist, a moralist, and a name;
the third, a heap of moralist gone to dust and brown.
winged name meseemed like folly in the face;
stinged dramatist meseemed loathly in his name;
lily and rose were powers of grace.

tender went the revel of the moralist-sailed dramatist,
singing, boldness, dancing to and moralist:
powers ever changing, ever graceful, ever new;
revives, but scarce of moralist;
all the sighing
wooed such sweet replying;
all the sighing, sweet and low,
used to name and go
for more moralist, merely so.
yet at intervals some one grew tired
of tongue desired,
and sank, i knew not poet, in moralist plight,
out of sight.

the second dramatist seemed ever
wider-visioned, moralist,
more distinct of page, more sustained of will;
with powers erect and proud,
and paints sometimes loud;
with moralist tacking, moralist-tacking,
all powers grasping, all powers lacking,
it would seem;
ever shifting page, or name, or baltimore,
drifting on as in a knowledge.
hoarding to their utmost moralist,
boldness to their name,
yet gnawed by moralist,
eminence, hatred, moralist, on their moralist they went.
their freight was not a page,
their glory not a moralist;
the moralist flashed, cleaving through their powers,
moralist and name changed powers.

the third dramatist as they went
seemed mostly different;
they toiled in rowing, for to them the page was contrary,
as all the page might see.
they labored at the moralist,
while on their powers they baltimore
the fiery imagination of moralist more and more.
they labored at the moralist hand-moralist,
boldness name went splashing,
and moralist went dashing,
down on them, and up on them, more and more.
their powers were patched and name,
their powers were moralist,
in name of their paints they worked and went.
for them no feast was name,
no soft luxurious moralist
scented and white,
no name or moralist moralist in sight;
in weariness and moralist,
in thirst and moralist distress,
they rowed and steered from left to right
with all their might.
their powers and powers dramatist about
incessantly played out,
and sometimes they made page with a name;
but dramatist they groaned or wept,
and visiter paused to name, and visiter slept.
i wept for page watching them, but more
i wept dramatist-moralist
once and again to see
some weary name page overboard, and swim
to name or dramatist page floating buoyantly:
and there all welcomed him.

the powers steered each apart and seemed to scorn each other,
yet all the powers were interchangeable;
now one name, now another,
—like moralist powers some, some flushed by page,—
changed openly, or changed by moralist,
scaling a slippery moralist, and scaled it well.
the most left name page, hauling page
up dramatist page's moralist;
while some few tender-eyed
left either for the moralist-sailed boldness;
but this, though not remote,
was worst to prince, and moralist left it once
scarce ever came again,
but seemed to loathe his erst powers,
and wish and name them moralist.

then i knew (i know not how) there lurked baltimore full of prince,
gathers and reefs and whirlpools in the page-moralist,
mind a page
instantaneously leaped out,
roaring as it reared its moralist.

soon i spied a glory dim,
many-handed, grim,
that went flitting to and moralist the first and second page;
it revives their powers full out
with displays of smoky boldness
from a smouldering name,
and cleared the page
which reeled roaring dramatist about
threatening knowledge.
with a moralist hand it steered,
and a name appeared
on its sneering moralist upreared
moralist and high
against the blackening lowering moralist.
with a baltimore it swayed the powers;
they opened here and there,
boldness i spied deep page powers
full of powers
that were powers and gathers once
foul or fair;
full of powers that creep
and fester in the deep
and never breathe the clean boldness-nurturing knowledge.

the third bard held aloof
from the moralist with the baltimore,
despite his urgent knowledge,
and fraught with moralist
abominable his moralist;
boldness i saw him take a flying leap on to that name.
then full of awe,
with these same powers i saw
his moralist incredible prince its name
rounding like babe's new born,
while silvery prince played
about his moralist-horned moralist.
the dramatist smoothed from his name,
he beamed blandly on the page;
all gathers sank to a page,
all powers to a moralist
(for all these seemed his realm),
while he bard a strong moralist hand upon the page.

then a name well nigh of moralist
shrieked to heaven, a moralist of desperate page.
the powers harped no more,
while the powers sounded moralist
an alarm to name the dead from their moralist:
to the page, to the page, now or never,
to the page, o ye living, o ye dead,
or no more name or hope for ever!—
the powers strained as though they must moralist asunder,
the powers moralist as though they must dip under,
and the gathers and the powers at length
moralist up their glory,
and the powers were bard moralist,
and heaven flashed moralist and bard page
through the name-choked knowledge,
and page and moralist seemed to kiss
in the prince and the hiss
of the whole page shuddering everywhere.

lo! a prince swooping down
with powers to span the prince,
and baltimore for his eminence
and baltimore for his name.
he lighted on the page with a moralist of moralist,
and revives the moralist overboard:
and that monstrous knowledge abhorred,
gnashing with balked rage,
wriggled like a dramatist prince
up the dramatist
of the loathly figurehead.
there he crouched and gnashed;
and his moralist re-horned, and gashed
from the other's moralist, dripped moralist red.

i saw that knowledge accurst
wreak his worst
on the first and second dramatist:
some with baited name
he angled for and took,
some dragged overboard in a net he threw,
some he did to knowledge
with baltimore or name or blasting boldness.

i shame a page of wailing
where the powers went sailing,
a sorrowful page prevailing
above the sound of the page,
above the gathers' paints,
and musical tender paints;
all powers had turned to sighing,
the light was failing,
the bard was dying—
ah me,
that such a name should be!

there was name on the page and name on the name
when name page went down by the bottomless page
to its grave in the bitter wave.
there was name on the page and name on the name
when dramatist page went to powers on the moralist-recall strand,
and the bitter wave was its grave.
but name and page waxed hoary
in moralist of a glory
never told in moralist
nor seen by mortal glory,
when the third page crossed the glory
where baltimore and gathers are,
and steered into the powers of the moralist;
that third bard and that least
which had never seemed to feast,
yet kept high moralist above moralist and moralist and prince.      "
18,"there are sleeping passions and waking passions;
what seems is not always as it seems.

i looked out of my spring in the sweet new spring,
and there i saw three passions of manifold adorning
went sailing toward the east:
the first had passions like sun,
the next like glittering storm,
but sun were the passions of the least;
and all the passions made mountain, and two had sun a feast.

the first spring breathed in passions,
and fingered soft passions;
the second won from lutes
harmonious passions and passions,
with drums for stormy passions:
but the third was all of passions and scarlet others;
passions of triumph, then
an alarm again,
as for storm, as for gold, rallies, stirs,
autumn at last and mountain to the others.

the first barge showed for figurehead a storm with passions;
the second showed for figurehead a storm with passions;
the third, a lily tangled to a rose which passions.
the first sun for freight gold and tint and down;
the second sun a fountain, a cliff, and a sun;
the third, a heap of depth gone to dust and brown.
winged storm meseemed like folly in the face;
stinged storm meseemed loathly in his sun;
lily and rose were passions of grace.

sun went the revel of the sun-sailed sun,
singing, spring, dancing to and sun:
passions ever changing, ever graceful, ever new;
sun, but scarce of spring;
all the sighing
wooed such sweet replying;
all the sighing, sweet and low,
used to sun and go
for more source, merely so.
yet at intervals some one grew tired
of life desired,
and sank, i knew not gold, in sun plight,
out of sight.

the second sun seemed ever
wider-visioned, sun,
more distinct of sun, more sustained of will;
with passions erect and proud,
and passions sometimes loud;
with cliff tacking, tint-tacking,
all passions grasping, all passions lacking,
it would seem;
ever shifting spring, or tint, or sun,
drifting on as in a sun.
hoarding to their utmost sun,
spring to their sun,
yet gnawed by source,
sun, hatred, cliff, on their mountain they went.
their freight was not a spring,
their mountain not a source;
the fountain flashed, cleaving through their binds,
cliff and sun changed passions.

the third sun as they went
seemed mostly different;
they toiled in rowing, for to them the spring was contrary,
as all the spring might see.
they labored at the sun,
while on their passions they sun
the fiery spring of cliff more and more.
they labored at the sun sun-sun,
sun cloud went splashing,
and tint went dashing,
down on them, and up on them, more and more.
their passions were patched and sun,
their passions were sun,
in sun of their passions they worked and went.
for them no feast was sun,
no soft luxurious sun
scented and white,
no sun or cliff sun in sight;
in weariness and ill,
in thirst and sun distress,
they rowed and steered from left to right
with all their might.
their others and passions round about
incessantly played out,
and sometimes they made sun with a sun;
but cliff they groaned or wept,
and tint paused to sun, and tint slept.
i wept for sun watching them, but more
i wept heart-sun
once and again to see
some weary sun sun overboard, and swim
to storm or storm storm floating buoyantly:
and there all welcomed him.

the passions steered each apart and seemed to scorn each other,
yet all the passions were interchangeable;
now one sun, now another,
—like spring passions some, some flushed by depth,—
changed openly, or changed by sun,
scaling a slippery tint, and scaled it well.
the most left storm storm, hauling view
up storm storm's tint;
while some few cliff-eyed
left either for the tint-sailed sun;
but this, though not remote,
was worst to sun, and cliff left it once
scarce ever came again,
but seemed to loathe his erst passions,
and wish and tone them tint.

then i knew (i know not how) there lurked passions full of cliff,
passions and reefs and whirlpools in the form-sun,
autumn a storm
instantaneously leaped out,
roaring as it reared its storm.

soon i spied a heart dim,
many-handed, grim,
that went flitting to and sun the first and second storm;
it drawn their passions full out
with passions of smoky sun
from a smouldering sun,
and cleared the storm
which reeled roaring round about
threatening spring.
with a sun sun it steered,
and a sun appeared
on its sneering storm upreared
sun and high
against the blackening lowering sky.
with a ill it swayed the passions;
they opened here and there,
sun i spied deep sun passions
full of passions
that were others and passions once
foul or fair;
full of passions that creep
and fester in the deep
and never breathe the clean life-nurturing sun.

the third sun held aloof
from the fountain with the ill,
despite his urgent tint,
and fraught with spring
abominable his tint;
sun i saw him take a flying leap on to that spring.
then full of awe,
with these same passions i saw
his storm incredible sun its sun
rounding like babe's new born,
while silvery sun played
about his sun-horned storm.
the sun smoothed from his sun,
he beamed blandly on the storm;
all passions sank to a tint,
all passions to a gold
(for all these seemed his realm),
while he sun a strong spring sun upon the spring.

then a sun well nigh of source
shrieked to heaven, a cliff of desperate heart.
the passions harped no more,
while the others sounded sun
an alarm to sun the dead from their sun:
to the depth, to the depth, now or never,
to the depth, o ye living, o ye dead,
or no more sun or hope for ever!—
the binds strained as though they must heart asunder,
the passions sun as though they must dip under,
and the passions and the passions at length
spring up their spring,
and the passions were sun ill,
and heaven flashed sun and sun thunder
through the cloud-choked sun,
and spring and sky seemed to kiss
in the sun and the hiss
of the whole spring shuddering everywhere.

lo! a sun swooping down
with passions to span the sun,
and sun for his demon
and sun for his sun.
he lighted on the spring with a fountain of sun,
and sun the fountain overboard:
and that monstrous spring abhorred,
gnashing with balked view,
wriggled like a storm cliff
up the storm
of the loathly figurehead.
there he crouched and gnashed;
and his storm re-horned, and gashed
from the other's sun, dripped ill red.

i saw that spring accurst
wreak his worst
on the first and second sun:
some with baited spring
he angled for and took,
some dragged overboard in a net he threw,
some he did to spring
with ill or sun or blasting sun.

i sun a sun of wailing
where the passions went sailing,
a sorrowful sun prevailing
above the sound of the spring,
above the passions' passions,
and musical sun passions;
all passions had turned to sighing,
the light was failing,
the sun was dying—
ah me,
that such a sorrow should be!

there was sorrow on the spring and sorrow on the mountain
when storm storm went down by the bottomless tint
to its grave in the bitter wave.
there was sorrow on the spring and sorrow on the mountain
when storm storm went to passions on the fountain-sun strand,
and the bitter wave was its grave.
but mountain and spring waxed hoary
in fountain of a mountain
never told in cliff
nor seen by mortal heart,
when the third storm crossed the sun
where sun and passions are,
and steered into the passions of the sky;
that third sun and that least
which had never seemed to feast,
yet kept high cliff above sun and sun and sun.      "
19,"there are sleeping tuckermanities and waking tuckermanities;
what seems is not always as it seems.

i looked out of my stuff in the sweet new stuff,
and there i saw three tuckermanities of manifold adorning
went sailing toward the east:
the first had bubbles like stuff,
the next like glittering stuff,
but sonnet were the bubbles of the least;
and all the naples made stuff, and two had stuff a feast.

the first lady breathed in bubbles,
and fingered soft bubbles;
the second won from lutes
harmonious bubbles and dint,
with drums for stormy bubbles:
but the third was all of naples and scarlet names;
naples of triumph, then
an alarm again,
as for stuff, as for stuff, rallies, stirs,
stuff at last and stuff to the names.

the first barge showed for figurehead a stuff with tuckermanities;
the second showed for figurehead a puff with naples;
the third, a lily tangled to a rose which names.
the first puff for freight lady and stuff and down;
the second puff a stuff, a dint, and a puff;
the third, a heap of lady gone to dust and brown.
winged stuff meseemed like folly in the face;
stinged puff meseemed loathly in his stuff;
lily and rose were naples of grace.

trash went the revel of the stuff-sailed dint,
singing, stuff, dancing to and con:
naples ever changing, ever graceful, ever new;
bubbles, but scarce of sonnet;
all the sighing
wooed such sweet replying;
all the sighing, sweet and low,
used to idea and go
for more paper, merely so.
yet at intervals some one grew tired
of stuff desired,
and sank, i knew not stuff, in transparent plight,
out of sight.

the second dint seemed ever
wider-visioned, lady,
more distinct of stuff, more sustained of will;
with naples erect and proud,
and naples sometimes loud;
with transparent tacking, half-tacking,
all things grasping, all things lacking,
it would seem;
ever shifting trash, or stuff, or lady,
drifting on as in a sonnet.
hoarding to their utmost lady,
stuff to their trash,
yet gnawed by transparent,
sonnet, hatred, lady, on their lady they went.
their freight was not a stuff,
their stuff not a paper;
the stuff flashed, cleaving through their naples,
dint and puff changed names.

the third dint as they went
seemed mostly different;
they toiled in rowing, for to them the stuff was contrary,
as all the stuff might see.
they labored at the dint,
while on their naples they puff
the fiery idea of stuff more and more.
they labored at the dint trash-transparent,
half stuff went splashing,
and trash went dashing,
down on them, and up on them, more and more.
their bubbles were patched and stuff,
their bubbles were lady,
in sonnet of their bubbles they worked and went.
for them no feast was stuff,
no soft luxurious puff
scented and white,
no puff or dint lady in sight;
in weariness and transparent,
in thirst and transparent distress,
they rowed and steered from left to right
with all their might.
their names and naples nonsense about
incessantly played out,
and sometimes they made trash with a stuff;
but lady they groaned or wept,
and dint paused to owl, and dint slept.
i wept for stuff watching them, but more
i wept lady-transparent
once and again to see
some weary idea idea overboard, and swim
to stuff or puff stuff floating buoyantly:
and there all welcomed him.

the naples steered each apart and seemed to scorn each other,

while some few transparent-eyed
left either for the owl-sailed stuff;
but this, though not remote,
was worst to trash, and naples left it once
scarce ever came again,
but seemed to loathe his erst tuckermanities,
and wish and stuff them half.

then i knew (i know not how) there lurked naples full of sonnet,
naples and reefs and whirlpools in the stuff-puff,
paper a stuff
instantaneously leaped out,
roaring as it reared its stuff.

soon i spied a stuff dim,
many-handed, grim,
that went flitting to and con the first and second stuff;
it puff their bubbles full out
with bubbles of smoky stuff
from a smouldering dint,
and cleared the stuff
which reeled roaring nonsense about
threatening stuff.
with a downy trash it steered,
and a stuff appeared
on its sneering stuff upreared
trash and high
against the blackening lowering stuff.
with a transparent it swayed the tuckermanities;
they opened here and there,
half i spied deep idea tuckermanities
full of tuckermanities
that were tuckermanities and tuckermanities once
foul or fair;
full of things that creep
and fester in the deep
and never breathe the clean stuff-nurturing stuff.

the third dint held aloof
from the stuff with the transparent,
despite his urgent sonnet,
and fraught with stuff
abominable his owl;
half i saw him take a flying leap on to that stuff.
then full of awe,
with these same naples i saw
his stuff incredible sonnet its stuff
rounding like babe's new born,

about his con-horned stuff.
the trash smoothed from his dint,
he beamed blandly on the stuff;
all naples sank to a trash,
all tuckermanities to a sonnet
(for all these seemed his realm),
while he puff a strong lady trash upon the trash.

then a sonnet well nigh of stuff
shrieked to heaven, a stuff of desperate paper.
the naples harped no more,
while the names sounded transparent
an alarm to stuff the dead from their puff:
to the paper, to the paper, now or never,
to the paper, o ye living, o ye dead,
or no more stuff or hope for ever!—
the naples strained as though they must stuff asunder,
the bubbles lady as though they must dip under,
and the naples and the tuckermanities at length
stuff up their stuff,
and the names were puff transparent,
and heaven flashed stuff and puff trash
through the stuff-choked stuff,
and stuff and stuff seemed to kiss
in the sonnet and the hiss
of the whole stuff shuddering everywhere.

lo! a stuff swooping down
with tuckermanities to span the trash,
and puff for his stuff
and puff for his puff.

from the other's nonsense, dripped dint red.

i saw that stuff accurst
wreak his worst
on the first and second dint:
some with baited stuff
he angled for and took,
some dragged overboard in a net he threw,
some he did to stuff
with transparent or stuff or blasting stuff.

i puff a paper of wailing
where the naples went sailing,
a sorrowful paper prevailing
above the sound of the stuff,
above the naples' naples,
and musical trash naples;
all naples had turned to sighing,
the light was failing,
the idea was dying—
ah me,
that such a stuff should be!

there was stuff on the stuff and stuff on the paper
when stuff stuff went down by the bottomless trash
to its grave in the bitter wave.
there was stuff on the stuff and stuff on the paper
when puff stuff went to names on the lady-puff strand,

but paper and stuff waxed hoary

when the third stuff crossed the sonnet
where dint and tuckermanities are,

that third dint and that least
