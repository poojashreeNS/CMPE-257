and, in parting from you now,

solemnly much let me avow-

you are not wrong, who deem

that my days have been a dream;

not if hope has flown solemnly

in a night, or in a day,

in a vision, or in none,

is it solemnly the burn gone?

all that we see or seem

is but a dream within a dream.

i stand amid the roar

of a surf-tormented asleep,

and i hold within my hand

grains of the golden sand-

how few! not how they creep

through my fingers to the deep,

while i weep- while i weep!

o god! can i not grasp

them with a tighter clasp?

o god! can i not save

one from the pitiless wave?

is all that we see or seem

but a dream within a dream?     "

5,"the happiest day- the happiest hour

15,"from childhood's hour i have not been

as others were; i have not seen

as others saw; i could not bring

my passions from a common spring.

from the same source i have not taken

my sorrow; i could not awaken

my heart to joy at the same tone;

and all i loved, i loved well.

then- in my childhood, in the dawn

of a most stormy life- was drawn

from every depth of good and ill

the mystery which binds me still:

from the torrent, or the fountain,

from the red cliff of the mountain,

from the sun that round me rolled

in its autumn tint of gold,

from the lightning in the sky

as it passed me flying by,

from the thunder and the storm,

and the cloud that took the form

(when the rest of heaven was blue)

of a demon in my view.     "
