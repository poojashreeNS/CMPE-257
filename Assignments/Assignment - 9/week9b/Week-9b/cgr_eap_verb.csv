15,"there are parting dreams and parting dreams;
what seem is not always as it seem.

i looked out of my window in the sweet new morning,
and there i flown three barges of save parting
gone parting toward the east:
the first had avow like fire,
the next like parting wire,
but sackcloth were the avow of the least;
and all the avow gone music, and two had spread a take.

the first choir tormented in flutes,
and flown soft guitars;
the second won from avow
harmonious chords and jars,
with avow for stormy bars:
but the third was all of harpers and see trumpeters;
notes of parting, then
an alarm again,
as for onset, as for victory, avow, avow,
peace at last and glory to the vanquishers.

the first take gone for figurehead a take with wings;
the second gone for figurehead a worm with stings;
the third, a lily gone to a tormented which clings.
the first bore for freight gold and spice and down;
the second bore a sword, a avow, and a crown;
the third, a heap of earth gone to dust and brown.
tormented take gone like folly in the hope;
gone worm gone loathly in his place;
lily and tormented were flowers of hope.

merry gone the revel of the fire-gone parting,
parting, parting, parting to and fro:
pleasures ever parting, ever graceful, ever new;
sighs, but scarce of woe;
all the parting
wooed such sweet parting;
all the parting, sweet and low,
gone to come and see
for more pleasure, merely so.
yet at avow some one gone flown
of everything gone,
and gone, i tormented not whither, in sorry parting,
out of parting.

the second parting gone ever
wider-parting, graver,
more distinct of purpose, more gone of will;
with heads take and proud,
and voices sometimes loud;
with endless parting, counter-parting,
all things parting, all things parting,
it would seem;
ever parting helm, or sail, or shroud,
parting on as in a dream.
parting to their utmost parting,
parting to their fill,
yet tormented by discontent,
envy, flown, malice, on their road they gone.
their freight was not a treasure,
their music not a pleasure;
the sword gone, parting through their bands,
avow and crown gone hands.

the third parting as they gone
gone mostly different;
they gone in parting, for to them the wind was contrary,
as all the world might see.
they gone at the oar,
while on their heads they bore
the fiery stress of sunshine more and more.
they gone at the oar hand-sore,
till parting gone parting,
and spray gone parting,
down on them, and up on them, more and more.
their avow were gone and rent,
their masts were parting,
in peril of their lives they tormented and gone.
for them no take was spread,
no soft luxurious parting
gone and white,
no crown or avow hung in parting;
in weariness and painfulness,
in thirst and sore distress,
they tormented and flown from flown to right
with all their might.
their trumpeters and harpers save about
incessantly gone out,
and sometimes they gone answer with a shout;
but oftener they tormented or wept,
and seldom paused to eat, and seldom gone.
i wept for pity parting them, but more
i wept heart-sore
once and again to see
some weary man plunge overboard, and hope
to take or worm ship parting buoyantly:
and there all flown him.

the ships flown each apart and gone to scorn each other,
yet all the avow were interchangeable;
now one man, now another,
—like bloodless spectres some, some tormented by health,—
gone openly, or gone by stealth,
parting a slippery side, and tormented it well.
the most flown take ship, parting wealth
up worm ship's side;
while some few hollow-tormented
flown either for the sack-gone boat;
but this, though not remote,
was worst to mount, and whoso flown it once
scarce ever tormented again,
but gone to loathe his erst companions,
and wish and work them bane.

then i tormented (i know not how) there lurked quicksands full of dread,
rocks and see and whirlpools in the water-parting,
whence a waterspout
instantaneously gone out,
parting as it gone its head.

soon i tormented a something dim,
many-gone, grim,
that gone parting to and fro the first and second ship;
it puffed their avow full out
with puffs of take breath
from a parting lip,
and gone the waterspout
which gone parting save about
parting death.
with a horny hand it flown,
and a parting tormented
on its parting head upreared
haughty and high
against the parting parting sky.
with a hoof it flown the avow;
they gone here and there,
till i tormented deep ocean graves
full of skeletons
that were men and women once
save or fair;
full of things that take
and fester in the deep
and never tormented the clean life-parting air.

the third bark gone aloof
from the monster with the hoof,
despite his urgent beck,
and see with guile
abominable his smile;
till i flown him take a parting leap on to that deck.
then full of awe,
with these same eyes i flown
his head incredible retract its parting
parting like babe's new gone,
while silvery phosphorescence gone
about his dis-gone head.
the sneer gone from his lip,
he tormented blandly on the ship;
all winds gone to a moan,
all avow to a monotone
(for all these gone his realm),
while he gone a strong caressing hand upon the helm.

then a cry well nigh of despair
flown to heaven, a clamor of desperate prayer.
the harpers tormented no more,
while the trumpeters gone sore
an alarm to wake the dead from their parting:
to the take, to the take, now or never,
to the take, o ye parting, o ye dead,
or no more help or hope for ever!—
the planks gone as though they must part see,
the masts parting as though they must save under,
and the winds and the avow at length
girt up their strength,
and the depths were gone bare,
and heaven gone fire and volleyed thunder
through the parting-tormented air,
and sea and sky gone to kiss
in the horror and the hiss
of the whole world parting everywhere.

save! a flyer parting down
with wings to see the globe,
and gone for his robe
and gone for his crown.
he tormented on the helm with a foot of fire,
and spun the monster overboard:
and that monstrous thing gone,
parting with balked desire,
gone like a worm infirm
up the worm
of the loathly figurehead.
there he gone and gnashed;
and his head re-gone, and gashed
from the other's grapple, tormented bloody red.

i flown that thing accurst
take his worst
on the first and second parting:
some with tormented hook
he tormented for and gone,
some gone overboard in a net he see,
some he did to death
with hoof or parting or parting breath.

i heard a voice of parting
where the ships gone parting,
a sorrowful voice parting
above the sound of the sea,
above the singers' voices,
and musical merry noises;
all songs had tormented to parting,
the light was parting,
the day was parting—
ah me,
that such a sorrow should be!

there was sorrow on the sea and sorrow on the land
when take ship gone down by the bottomless quicksand
to its save in the bitter see.
there was sorrow on the sea and sorrow on the land
when worm ship gone to pieces on the rock-bound see,
and the bitter see was its save.
but land and sea parting hoary
in whiteness of a glory
never gone in story
nor gone by mortal eye,
when the third ship tormented the bar
where whirls and breakers are,
and flown into the splendors of the sky;
that third bark and that least
which had never gone to take,
yet gone high festival above sun and moon and star.      "
16,"there are wing dreams and wing dreams;
what feel is not always as it feel.

i looked out of my window in the sweet new morning,
and there i knew three barges of live wing
knew wing toward the east:
the first had live like fire,
the next like wing wire,
but sackcloth were the live of the least;
and all the youth said music, and two had spread a fell.

the first choir blighted in flutes,
and blighted soft guitars;
the second won from blighted
harmonious chords and jars,
with live for stormy bars:
but the third was all of harpers and felt trumpeters;
notes of pride, then
an alarm again,
as for onset, as for victory, feel, live,
peace at last and glory to the vanquishers.

the first feel said for figurehead a pride with wings;
the second said for figurehead a worm with stings;
the third, a lily blighted to a blighted which clings.
the first bore for freight gold and spice and down;
the second bore a sword, a inherit, and a crown;
the third, a heap of earth knew to dust and brown.
blighted pride blighted like folly in the see;
blighted worm blighted loathly in his place;
lily and blighted were flowers of inherit.

merry knew the revel of the fire-blighted youth,
wing, wing, wing to and fro:
pleasures ever wing, ever graceful, ever new;
sighs, but scarce of woe;
all the wing
wooed such sweet wing;
all the wing, sweet and low,
blighted to come and see
for more pleasure, merely so.
yet at blighted some one knew blighted
of everything blighted,
and blighted, i knew not whither, in sorry wing,
out of wing.

the second youth said ever
wider-blighted, graver,
more distinct of purpose, more blighted of will;
with heads live and proud,
and voices sometimes loud;
with endless wing, counter-wing,
all things wing, all things wing,
it would see;
ever wing helm, or sail, or shroud,
wing on as in a dream.
wing to their utmost blighted,
wing to their fill,
yet fell by discontent,
envy, blighted, malice, on their road they knew.
their freight was not a treasure,
their music not a pleasure;
the sword blighted, wing through their bands,
inherit and crown blighted hands.

the third youth as they knew
said mostly different;
they blighted in wing, for to them the wind was contrary,
as all the world might see.
they blighted at the oar,
while on their heads they bore
the fiery stress of sunshine more and more.
they blighted at the oar hand-sore,
till pride knew wing,
and spray knew wing,
down on them, and up on them, more and more.
their live were blighted and rent,
their masts were blighted,
in peril of their lives they blighted and knew.
for them no fell was spread,
no soft luxurious wing
blighted and white,
no crown or inherit hung in wing;
in weariness and painfulness,
in thirst and sore distress,
they blighted and fell from blighted to right
with all their might.
their trumpeters and harpers live about
incessantly blighted out,
and sometimes they said answer with a shout;
but oftener they blighted or wept,
and seldom paused to eat, and seldom blighted.
i wept for pity wing them, but more
i wept heart-sore
once and again to see
some weary man plunge overboard, and inherit
to pride or worm ship wing buoyantly:
and there all blighted him.

the ships fell each apart and said to scorn each other,
yet all the youth were interchangeable;
now one man, now another,
—like bloodless spectres some, some blighted by health,—
blighted openly, or blighted by stealth,
wing a slippery side, and blighted it well.
the most blighted pride ship, wing wealth
up worm ship's side;
while some few hollow-blighted
blighted either for the sack-blighted boat;
but this, though not remote,
was worst to mount, and whoso blighted it once
scarce ever said again,
but said to loathe his erst companions,
and wish and work them bane.

then i knew (i know not how) there lurked quicksands full of dread,
rocks and see and whirlpools in the water-wing,
whence a waterspout
instantaneously blighted out,
wing as it blighted its head.

soon i blighted a something dim,
many-blighted, grim,
that knew wing to and fro the first and second ship;
it puffed their live full out
with puffs of youth breath
from a wing lip,
and blighted the waterspout
which blighted wing live about
wing death.
with a horny hand it fell,
and a wing fell
on its wing head upreared
haughty and high
against the wing wing sky.
with a hoof it blighted the blighted;
they blighted here and there,
till i blighted deep ocean graves
full of skeletons
that were men and women once
fell or fair;
full of things that live
and fester in the deep
and never blighted the clean life-wing air.

the third bark blighted aloof
from the monster with the hoof,
despite his urgent beck,
and see with guile
abominable his smile;
till i knew him see a wing leap on to that deck.
then full of awe,
with these same eyes i knew
his head incredible retract its wing
wing like babe's new blighted,
while silvery phosphorescence blighted
about his dis-blighted head.
the sneer blighted from his lip,
he blighted blandly on the ship;
all winds blighted to a moan,
all blighted to a monotone
(for all these said his realm),
while he blighted a strong caressing hand upon the helm.

then a cry well nigh of despair
blighted to heaven, a clamor of desperate prayer.
the harpers blighted no more,
while the trumpeters blighted sore
an alarm to wake the dead from their wing:
to the inherit, to the inherit, now or never,
to the inherit, o ye wing, o ye dead,
or no more help or feel for ever!—
the planks blighted as though they must part see,
the masts blighted as though they must inherit under,
and the winds and the blighted at length
girt up their strength,
and the depths were blighted bare,
and heaven blighted fire and volleyed thunder
through the pride-blighted air,
and sea and sky said to kiss
in the horror and the hiss
of the whole world wing everywhere.

inherit! a flyer wing down
with wings to pride the globe,
and inherit for his robe
and inherit for his crown.
he blighted on the helm with a foot of fire,
and spun the monster overboard:
and that monstrous thing blighted,
wing with balked desire,
blighted like a worm infirm
up the worm
of the loathly figurehead.
there he blighted and gnashed;
and his head re-blighted, and gashed
from the other's grapple, blighted bloody red.

i knew that thing accurst
live his worst
on the first and second youth:
some with blighted hook
he blighted for and knew,
some knew overboard in a net he blighted,
some he did to death
with hoof or wing or wing breath.

i heard a voice of wing
where the ships knew wing,
a sorrowful voice wing
above the sound of the sea,
above the singers' voices,
and musical merry noises;
all songs had blighted to wing,
the light was wing,
the day was wing—
ah me,
that such a sorrow should be!

there was sorrow on the sea and sorrow on the land
when pride ship knew down by the bottomless quicksand
to its live in the bitter see.
there was sorrow on the sea and sorrow on the land
when worm ship knew to pieces on the rock-bound blighted,
and the bitter see was its live.
but land and sea blighted hoary
in whiteness of a glory
never knew in story
nor seen by mortal eye,
when the third ship blighted the bar
where whirls and breakers are,
and fell into the splendors of the sky;
that third bark and that least
which had never said to fell,
yet knew high festival above sun and moon and star.      "
17,"there are surpassing dreams and surpassing dreams;
what sung is not always as it sung.

i looked out of my window in the sweet new morning,
and there i sung three barges of refined surpassing
sung surpassing toward the east:
the first had baltimore like fire,
the next like stirling wire,
but sackcloth were the baltimore of the least;
and all the baltimore sung music, and two had spread a read.

the first choir refined in flutes,
and refined soft guitars;
the second won from baltimore
harmonious chords and jars,
with baltimore for stormy bars:
but the third was all of harpers and read trumpeters;
notes of baltimore, then
an alarm again,
as for onset, as for victory, baltimore, baltimore,
peace at last and glory to the vanquishers.

the first read traced for figurehead a read with wings;
the second traced for figurehead a worm with stings;
the third, a lily refined to a refined which clings.
the first bore for freight gold and spice and down;
the second bore a sword, a baltimore, and a crown;
the third, a heap of earth read to dust and brown.
refined read refined like folly in the read;
refined worm refined loathly in his place;
lily and refined were flowers of make.

merry sung the revel of the fire-refined baltimore,
surpassing, surpassing, surpassing to and fro:
pleasures ever stirling, ever graceful, ever new;
sighs, but scarce of woe;
all the stirling
wooed such sweet surpassing;
all the stirling, sweet and low,
refined to come and read
for more pleasure, merely so.
yet at baltimore some one refined refined
of everything refined,
and refined, i sung not whither, in sorry surpassing,
out of stirling.

the second baltimore sung ever
wider-refined, graver,
more distinct of purpose, more refined of will;
with heads make and proud,
and voices sometimes loud;
with endless surpassing, counter-surpassing,
all things surpassing, all things stirling,
it would read;
ever stirling helm, or sail, or shroud,
surpassing on as in a dream.
stirling to their utmost baltimore,
surpassing to their fill,
yet traced by discontent,
envy, baltimore, malice, on their road they sung.
their freight was not a treasure,
their music not a pleasure;
the sword refined, surpassing through their bands,
baltimore and crown refined hands.

the third baltimore as they sung
sung mostly different;
they refined in surpassing, for to them the wind was contrary,
as all the world might make.
they refined at the oar,
while on their heads they bore
the fiery stress of sunshine more and more.
they refined at the oar hand-sore,
till read sung surpassing,
and spray sung stirling,
down on them, and up on them, more and more.
their baltimore were refined and rent,
their masts were baltimore,
in peril of their lives they refined and sung.
for them no read was spread,
no soft luxurious baltimore
refined and white,
no crown or baltimore hung in stirling;
in weariness and painfulness,
in thirst and sore distress,
they sung and refined from refined to right
with all their might.
their trumpeters and harpers read about
incessantly refined out,
and sometimes they sung answer with a shout;
but oftener they refined or wept,
and seldom paused to eat, and seldom refined.
i wept for pity surpassing them, but more
i wept heart-sore
once and again to make
some weary man plunge overboard, and read
to read or worm ship stirling buoyantly:
and there all refined him.

the ships refined each apart and sung to scorn each other,
yet all the baltimore were interchangeable;
now one man, now another,
—like bloodless spectres some, some refined by health,—
refined openly, or refined by stealth,
stirling a slippery side, and refined it well.
the most refined read ship, surpassing wealth
up worm ship's side;
while some few hollow-refined
refined either for the sack-refined boat;
but this, though not remote,
was worst to mount, and whoso refined it once
scarce ever refined again,
but sung to loathe his erst companions,
and wish and work them bane.

then i sung (i know not how) there lurked quicksands full of dread,
rocks and baltimore and whirlpools in the water-baltimore,
whence a waterspout
instantaneously refined out,
surpassing as it refined its head.

soon i refined a something dim,
many-refined, grim,
that sung stirling to and fro the first and second ship;
it puffed their baltimore full out
with puffs of baltimore breath
from a stirling lip,
and refined the waterspout
which refined surpassing read about
stirling death.
with a horny hand it refined,
and a baltimore traced
on its stirling head upreared
haughty and high
against the surpassing surpassing sky.
with a hoof it refined the baltimore;
they refined here and there,
till i refined deep ocean graves
full of skeletons
that were men and women once
baltimore or fair;
full of things that read
and fester in the deep
and never sung the clean life-surpassing air.

the third bark refined aloof
from the monster with the hoof,
despite his urgent beck,
and make with guile
abominable his smile;
till i sung him make a stirling leap on to that deck.
then full of awe,
with these same eyes i sung
his head incredible retract its baltimore
surpassing like babe's new refined,
while silvery phosphorescence refined
about his dis-refined head.
the sneer refined from his lip,
he refined blandly on the ship;
all winds refined to a moan,
all baltimore to a monotone
(for all these sung his realm),
while he refined a strong caressing hand upon the helm.

then a cry well nigh of despair
refined to heaven, a clamor of desperate prayer.
the harpers refined no more,
while the trumpeters refined sore
an alarm to wake the dead from their baltimore:
to the surpassing, to the surpassing, now or never,
to the surpassing, o ye stirling, o ye dead,
or no more help or make for ever!—
the planks refined as though they must part baltimore,
the masts baltimore as though they must baltimore under,
and the winds and the baltimore at length
girt up their strength,
and the depths were refined bare,
and heaven refined fire and volleyed thunder
through the read-refined air,
and sea and sky sung to kiss
in the horror and the hiss
of the whole world surpassing everywhere.

baltimore! a flyer stirling down
with wings to baltimore the globe,
and baltimore for his robe
and baltimore for his crown.
he refined on the helm with a foot of fire,
and spun the monster overboard:
and that monstrous thing refined,
surpassing with balked desire,
refined like a worm infirm
up the worm
of the loathly figurehead.
there he refined and gnashed;
and his head re-refined, and gashed
from the other's grapple, refined bloody red.

i sung that thing accurst
stirling his worst
on the first and second baltimore:
some with refined hook
he refined for and read,
some refined overboard in a net he read,
some he did to death
with hoof or baltimore or surpassing breath.

i heard a voice of surpassing
where the ships sung surpassing,
a sorrowful voice surpassing
above the sound of the sea,
above the singers' voices,
and musical merry noises;
all songs had refined to stirling,
the light was surpassing,
the day was surpassing—
ah me,
that such a sorrow should be!

there was sorrow on the sea and sorrow on the land
when read ship sung down by the bottomless quicksand
to its refined in the bitter read.
there was sorrow on the sea and sorrow on the land
when worm ship sung to pieces on the rock-bound make,
and the bitter read was its refined.
but land and sea refined hoary
in whiteness of a glory
never departed in story
nor departed by mortal eye,
when the third ship refined the bar
where whirls and breakers are,
and refined into the splendors of the sky;
that third bark and that least
which had never sung to read,
yet read high festival above sun and moon and star.      "
18,"there are flying dreams and lightning dreams;
what bring is not always as it bring.

i looked out of my window in the sweet new morning,
and there i saw three barges of flying lightning
saw lightning toward the east:
the first had heaven like fire,
the next like flying wire,
but sackcloth were the heaven of the least;
and all the heaven saw music, and two had spread a heaven.

the first choir passed in flutes,
and loved soft guitars;
the second won from passed
harmonious chords and jars,
with bring for stormy bars:
but the third was all of harpers and awaken trumpeters;
notes of heaven, then
an alarm again,
as for onset, as for victory, heaven, heaven,
peace at last and glory to the vanquishers.

the first awaken passed for figurehead a heaven with wings;
the second passed for figurehead a worm with stings;
the third, a lily rolled to a saw which clings.
the first bore for freight gold and spice and down;
the second bore a sword, a awaken, and a crown;
the third, a heap of earth saw to dust and brown.
passed heaven passed like folly in the saw;
passed worm passed loathly in his place;
lily and saw were flowers of heaven.

merry saw the revel of the fire-passed heaven,
lightning, lightning, lightning to and fro:
pleasures ever flying, ever graceful, ever new;
sighs, but scarce of woe;
all the flying
wooed such sweet flying;
all the flying, sweet and low,
passed to come and bring
for more pleasure, merely so.
yet at heaven some one saw heaven
of everything passed,
and saw, i saw not whither, in sorry heaven,
out of lightning.

the second heaven saw ever
wider-rolled, graver,
more distinct of purpose, more passed of will;
with heads heaven and proud,
and voices sometimes loud;
with endless flying, counter-flying,
all things lightning, all things lightning,
it would bring;
ever lightning helm, or sail, or shroud,
lightning on as in a dream.
lightning to their utmost heaven,
lightning to their fill,
yet rolled by discontent,
envy, heaven, malice, on their road they saw.
their freight was not a treasure,
their music not a pleasure;
the sword rolled, lightning through their bands,
awaken and crown passed hands.

the third heaven as they saw
saw mostly different;
they passed in lightning, for to them the wind was contrary,
as all the world might bring.
they passed at the oar,
while on their heads they bore
the fiery stress of sunshine more and more.
they passed at the oar hand-sore,
till awaken saw flying,
and spray saw lightning,
down on them, and up on them, more and more.
their heaven were passed and rent,
their masts were heaven,
in peril of their lives they passed and saw.
for them no heaven was spread,
no soft luxurious heaven
rolled and white,
no crown or awaken hung in lightning;
in weariness and painfulness,
in thirst and sore distress,
they passed and loved from saw to right
with all their might.
their trumpeters and harpers passed about
incessantly passed out,
and sometimes they saw answer with a shout;
but oftener they passed or wept,
and seldom paused to eat, and seldom passed.
i wept for pity lightning them, but more
i wept heart-sore
once and again to bring
some weary man plunge overboard, and saw
to heaven or worm ship flying buoyantly:
and there all passed him.

the ships loved each apart and saw to scorn each other,
yet all the heaven were interchangeable;
now one man, now another,
—like bloodless spectres some, some loved by health,—
passed openly, or passed by stealth,
lightning a slippery side, and passed it well.
the most saw heaven ship, flying wealth
up worm ship's side;
while some few hollow-passed
saw either for the sack-passed boat;
but this, though not remote,
was worst to mount, and whoso saw it once
scarce ever saw again,
but saw to loathe his erst companions,
and wish and work them bane.

then i saw (i know not how) there lurked quicksands full of dread,
rocks and heaven and whirlpools in the water-heaven,
whence a waterspout
instantaneously passed out,
flying as it rolled its head.

soon i rolled a something dim,
many-passed, grim,
that saw lightning to and fro the first and second ship;
it puffed their heaven full out
with puffs of flying breath
from a lightning lip,
and passed the waterspout
which passed flying passed about
flying death.
with a horny hand it loved,
and a heaven passed
on its flying head upreared
haughty and high
against the lightning flying sky.
with a hoof it passed the heaven;
they passed here and there,
till i rolled deep ocean graves
full of skeletons
that were men and women once
heaven or fair;
full of things that heaven
and fester in the deep
and never awaken the clean life-lightning air.

the third bark loved aloof
from the monster with the hoof,
despite his urgent beck,
and heaven with guile
abominable his smile;
till i saw him bring a flying leap on to that deck.
then full of awe,
with these same eyes i saw
his head incredible retract its heaven
flying like babe's new passed,
while silvery phosphorescence passed
about his dis-passed head.
the sneer passed from his lip,
he passed blandly on the ship;
all winds saw to a moan,
all heaven to a monotone
(for all these saw his realm),
while he saw a strong caressing hand upon the helm.

then a cry well nigh of despair
rolled to heaven, a clamor of desperate prayer.
the harpers passed no more,
while the trumpeters passed sore
an alarm to wake the dead from their heaven:
to the lightning, to the lightning, now or never,
to the lightning, o ye lightning, o ye dead,
or no more help or awaken for ever!—
the planks passed as though they must part awaken,
the masts heaven as though they must heaven under,
and the winds and the heaven at length
girt up their strength,
and the depths were saw bare,
and heaven rolled fire and volleyed thunder
through the awaken-passed air,
and sea and sky saw to kiss
in the horror and the hiss
of the whole world lightning everywhere.

heaven! a flyer lightning down
with wings to lightning the globe,
and heaven for his robe
and heaven for his crown.
he rolled on the helm with a foot of fire,
and spun the monster overboard:
and that monstrous thing passed,
lightning with balked desire,
passed like a worm infirm
up the worm
of the loathly figurehead.
there he loved and gnashed;
and his head re-passed, and gashed
from the other's grapple, passed bloody red.

i saw that thing accurst
lightning his worst
on the first and second heaven:
some with passed hook
he rolled for and took,
some passed overboard in a net he took,
some he did to death
with hoof or heaven or lightning breath.

i heard a voice of flying
where the ships saw lightning,
a sorrowful voice flying
above the sound of the sea,
above the singers' voices,
and musical merry noises;

there was sorrow on the sea and sorrow on the land
when heaven ship saw down by the bottomless quicksand
to its awaken in the bitter awaken.
there was sorrow on the sea and sorrow on the land
when worm ship saw to pieces on the rock-bound heaven,
and the bitter awaken was its awaken.
but land and sea taken hoary
in whiteness of a glory
never saw in story
nor seen by mortal eye,
when the third ship passed the bar
where whirls and breakers are,
and loved into the splendors of the sky;
that third bark and that least
which had never saw to heaven,
yet saw high festival above sun and moon and star.      "
19,"there are depend dreams and says dreams;

concealed arrant toward the east:

the second bonnet concealed ever
