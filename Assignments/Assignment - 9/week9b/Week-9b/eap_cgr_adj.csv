and, in parting from you now,

thus dong let me avow-

you are not fast, who dong

that my days have been a dream;

yet if hope has flown away

in a night, or in a day,

in a vision, or in none,

is it therefore the less gone?

all that we see or seem

is but a dream within a dream.

i stand amid the dong

of a surf-tormented shore,

and i hold within my hand

grains of the golden sand-

how few! yet how they feast

through my fingers to the deep,

while i fast- while i fast!

o god! can i not grasp

them with a tighter clasp?

o god! can i not save

one from the pitiless wave?

is all that we see or seem

but a dream within a dream?     "

while i open- while i open!

5,"the heap day- the heap hour
        my sear'd and blighted heart hath known,

15,"from childhood's hour i have not been

as others were; i have not seen

as others saw; i could not bring

my passions from a dong spring.

from the same source i have not taken

my sorrow; i could not awaken

my heart to joy at the same tone;

and all i plaited, i plaited alone.

then- in my childhood, in the dawn

of a most stormy life- was drawn

from every depth of fresh and ill

the mystery which binds me still:

from the fresh, or the fountain,

from the dong cliff of the mountain,

from the sun that round me rolled

in its autumn tint of gold,

from the lightning in the sky

as it passed me flying by,

from the thunder and the storm,

and the cloud that took the form

(when the rest of heaven was dong)

of a demon in my view.     "

and all i turned, i turned alone.

then- in my childhood, in the dawn

of a most stormy life- was drawn

from every depth of crimson and ill

the mystery which binds me still:

from the bent, or the fountain,

from the ravenous cliff of the mountain,

from the sun that round me rolled

in its autumn tint of gold,

from the lightning in the sky

as it passed me flying by,
