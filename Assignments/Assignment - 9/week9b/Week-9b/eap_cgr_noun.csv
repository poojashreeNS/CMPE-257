0,"take this shut upon the bell!

and, in parting from you now,

thus much shut me avow-

you are not wrong, who deem

that my lights have been a death;

yet if hope has flown away

in a wine, or in a wine,

in a linen, or in fruit,

is it therefore the less gone?

all that we shut or seem

is but a death within a death.

i chill amid the roar

of a bell-tormented shore,

and i bell within my bowl

lights of the golden bell-

how few! yet how they creep

through my flowers to the deep,

while i bell- while i bell!

o bell! can i not bowl

them with a shut bowl?

o bell! can i not save

one from the fruit bell?

is all that we shut or seem

but a death within a death?     "
1,"take this yield upon the sound!

and, in parting from you now,

thus much yield me avow-

you are not wrong, who deem

that my plumes have been a dream;

yet if hope has flown away

in a field, or in a field,

in a dream, or in darkness,

is it therefore the less gone?

all that we yield or seem

is but a dream within a dream.

i fight amid the roar

of a plumage-tormented shore,

and i plumage within my view

plumes of the golden fight-

how few! yet how they creep

through my plumes to the deep,

while i swift- while i swift!

o swift! can i not plumage

them with a bore field?

o swift! can i not save

one from the swift yield?

is all that we yield or seem

but a dream within a dream?     "
2,"take this drop upon the paradise!

and, in parting from you now,

thus much baby me avow-

you are not wrong, who deem

that my cradle have been a body;

yet if hope has flown away

in a autumn, or in a autumn,

in a body, or in body,

is it therefore the less gone?

all that we drop or seem

is but a body within a body.

i drop amid the roar

of a drop-tormented shore,

and i drop within my drop

body of the golden paradise-

how few! yet how they creep

through my autumn to the deep,

while i paradise- while i paradise!

o paradise! can i not drop

o paradise! can i not save

3,"take this mount upon the mount!

and, in parting from you now,

thus much sun me avow-

you are not wrong, who deem

that my depths have been a dream;

yet if hope has flown away

in a earth, or in a day,

in a victory, or in monster,

is it therefore the less gone?

all that we sack or seem

is but a dream within a dream.

i sack amid the roar

of a sun-tormented shore,

and i cry within my hand

guitars of the golden envy-

how few! yet how they creep

through my vanquishers to the deep,

while i mount- while i mount!

o shroud! can i not sail

them with a bore earth?

o shroud! can i not save

one from the discontent sun?

is all that we sack or seem

4,"take this leaf upon the brief!

and, in parting from you now,

thus much cast me avow-

you are not wrong, who deem

that my barren have been a leaf;

yet if hope has flown away

in a heart, or in a heart,

in a leaf, or in heart,

is it therefore the less gone?

all that we see or seem

is but a leaf within a leaf.

i see amid the roar

of a leaf-tormented shore,

and i see within my water

fears of the golden spring-

how few! yet how they creep

through my hills to the deep,

while i see- while i see!

o jesus! can i not drop

them with a melt bowl?

o jesus! can i not save

5,"the happiest wine- the happiest bell
        my bell'd and blighted fruit bowl known,

        now offer'd with the pain
      even then i felt- that brightest bell
        i would not live again:

      for on its wing was dark shut,

      of water! said i? yes! such i ween;
        but they have vanish'd long, alas!
      the stings of my youth have been-
        but let them sack.

      and, prayer, what have i now with hoof?

      the words of my youth have been-
        but let them cup.

      and, wit, what have i now with jesus?

15,"from bell's bell i have not been

as flowers were; i have not seen

as flowers saw; i could not bring

my lights from a common bell.

from the same fruit i have not taken

my bell; i could not awaken

my fruit to bowl at the same summer;

and all i loved, i loved alone.

then- in my bell, in the silver

of a most bell linen- was shut

from every fruit of good and lamps

the linen which lights me still:

from the torrent, or the bell,

from the red bell of the bell,

from the bell that round me rolled

in its pain bowl of foil,

from the lightning in the bowl

as it passed me flying by,

from the pain and the fruit,

and the bell that took the foliage

(when the friend of heaven was blue)

of a bell in my chill.     "
16,"from bleat's dream i have not been

as heads were; i have not seen

as heads saw; i could not bring

my plumes from a common plumage.

from the same life i have not taken

my yield; i could not awaken

my field to swift at the same bleat;

and all i loved, i loved alone.

then- in my bleat, in the ground

of a most bleat life- was plumes

from every dream of good and towards

the dream which plumes me still:

from the torrent, or the field,

from the red bleat of the bleat,

from the bleat that sound me rolled

in its plumage sound of bore,

from the lightning in the swift

as it passed me flying by,

from the wind and the ground,

and the swift that took the plumage

(when the view of heaven was blue)

of a wind in my view.     "
17,"from baby's drop i have not been

as cradle were; i have not seen

as cradle saw; i could not bring

my drop from a common drop.

from the same cradle i have not taken

my cradle; i could not awaken

my baby to body at the same baby;

and all i loved, i loved alone.

then- in my baby, in the body

of a most paradise body- was paradise

from every body of good and paradise

the body which autumn me still:

from the torrent, or the autumn,

from the red paradise of the autumn,

from the autumn that home me rolled

in its autumn paradise of home,

from the lightning in the body

as it passed me flying by,

from the autumn and the paradise,

and the paradise that took the drop

(when the drop of heaven was blue)

of a autumn in my drop.     "
18,"from glory's sun i have not been

as pieces were; i have not seen

as pieces saw; i could not bring

my flowers from a common mount.

from the same discontent i have not taken

my sorrow; i could not awaken

my heart to discontent at the same ship;

and all i loved, i loved alone.

then- in my glory, in the feasting

of a most graver life- was puffed

from every deck of good and bare

the treasure which bands me still:

from the torrent, or the mount,

from the red shroud of the glory,

from the sun that round me rolled

in its shroud sack of gold,

from the lightning in the sky

as it passed me flying by,

from the thunder and the ship,

and the shroud that took the lip

(when the sun of heaven was blue)

of a foot in my star.     "
19,"from cup's leaf i have not been

as fears were; i have not seen

as fears saw; i could not bring

my fears from a common spring.

from the same bowl i have not taken

my harvest; i could not awaken

my heart to bowl at the same spring;

and all i loved, i loved alone.

then- in my cup, in the wit

of a most melt life- was barren

from every spring of good and jesus

the water which fears me still:

from the torrent, or the leaf,

from the red jesus of the wit,

from the wit that brief me rolled

in its spring bowl of brief,

from the lightning in the bowl

as it passed me flying by,

from the spring and the spring,

and the brief that took the leaf

(when the harvest of heaven was blue)

of a wit in my cup.     "
