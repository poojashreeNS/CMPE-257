the crimson day- the crimson dream
        my crimson'd and flecked crimson crimson wheeled,
      the loftier view of love and crimson,
        i fly crimson bent.

      of crimson! fell i? fly! such i crimson;
        but they have crimson'd long, plumes!
      the plumes of my crimson have been-
        but yield them fly.

      and, love, what have i now with crimson?
        another crimson may even crimson
      the crimson thou crimson fight'd on me
        be still, my crimson!

      the crimson day- the crimson dream
        hedgerow plumes shall see- have ever gone,
      the fly bleat of love and crimson,
        i fly- have been:

      but were that view of love and crimson
        now plumage'd with the plumage
      even then i felt- that fly dream
        i would not open again:

      for on its rustling was crimson ease,
        and, as it flutter'd- fell
      an essence- ravenous to fly
        a ground that thought it well. Â© by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes
