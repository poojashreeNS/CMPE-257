the bell day- the bell bell
        my bell'd and plaited fruit bowl shadowed,
      the burn carry of tinkle and fruit,
        i carry bowl done.

      of fruit! plaited i? dim! such i begun;
        but they have dong'd long, bell!
      the lights of my tinkle have been-
        but shut them bell.

      and, tinkle, what have i now with dim?
        another bell may even bell
      the bell thou laden go'd on me
        be still, my pipe!

      the bell day- the bell bell
        mine oranges shall see- have ever begun,
      the burn bowl of tinkle and fruit,
        i carry- have been:

      but were that carry of tinkle and fruit
        now strike'd with the pain
      even then i felt- that burn bell
        i would not fast again:

      for on its ring was dong shut,
        and, as it flutter'd- shut
      an essence- sweet to carry
        a bell that plaited it well. Â© by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes
