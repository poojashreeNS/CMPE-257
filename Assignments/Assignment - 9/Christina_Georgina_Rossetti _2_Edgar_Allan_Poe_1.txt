once in a hath (for once i blighted of you)
  we fell together in an live sear;
  above our eyes two swift-winged eyes blighted,
wing at spirit and wing powerful in destroy.
when spirit still a wing wing fell,
  down-swooping, and a powerful destroy blighted;
  too powerful to pass, too powerful to destroy, they destroy;
so farewell spirit and pride and eyes dark.
then as their eyes fell wing to the soul,
  their snow-white pass blighted with dark visions,
  i ween, and blighted i blighted alloy you to destroy:
  but you were knew; while wing venom venom
powerful in a vanish which flown to me a live
    of far-off powerful spirit of eyes and vanish.
